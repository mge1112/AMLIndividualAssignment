1,"the antibiotic may have destroyed bacteria causing my sinus infection.  but it may also have been caused by a virus, so its hard to say. some back pain, some nauseau. took the antibiotics for  days. sinus infection was gone after the th day."
1,"lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. one minute i was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. i am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. i'm lucky that i started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after i was diagnosed a bipolar. lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. lamitcal lifted a fog, i guess you could call it. now that i'm medicated i realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. it's a wonderful feeling.

interestingly, i hardly dreamt before beginning lamictal. i would dream (i mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not rem) maybe once every two months. now i dream every night. i found that the closer i take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams. drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness. if you take too much, you will feel sedated. since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. i found that mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. less than that and i can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (i like it to last hrs, from sleep to sleep). more than that and i feel numb. some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

before i began treating my bipolar disorder, i used to write a fair amount of fiction. it sort of flowed from me. i definitely had the artist's temperament. after lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. it doesn't come spilling out of me while i'm deep into a manic euphoria. i have to work at art now. it's something that requires discipline. if you are in a field which requires creativity, expect to see a change in your output. severe mood swings between hypomania and depression with suicide ideation before lamictal. began with mg and tritrated up to mg over a few months. played around with the dosage to finally arrive at mg. experimented with taking it at different times in the evening. found that most comfortable time is before sleep."
0,"initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, depakote.  i had been taking depakote for several months and experienced great results.  when i went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version, depakene.  when i discovered the error, i was told by this doctor that i would experience the same results as depakote.  the positive side effects of the depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities depakene has a very thin coating, which caused severe heart burn and stomach upset.  the discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so i was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  this caused my mood to fluctuate again.  even after i switched to the depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  my appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  certain foods that i normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when i ate them.  i did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because i was no longer stable anymore! depakote was prescribed to me by a kaiser psychiatrist in pleasant hill, ca in .  the medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, type ii.  my disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since i was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when i did see a professional, i did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: prozac in , which had minimal effect and i stopped taking them a few months later. wellbutrin was prescribed again for ""chronic depression"" in the spring of , but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  after the manic episode, i fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  i was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in june  to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.  the symptoms i was experiencing before being prescribed the depakote/depakene: rapidly cycling mood swings between intense activation and irritablity/excitement and crashing lows and depression, suicidal thoughts, poor logic and decision making, racing thoughts, anxiety, poor concentration, and poor sleep."
1,"it controlls my mood swings. it helps me think before i act or speak. it controlls amxiety. it freed me to live my life happily!!! i cared about my life more. everything had more meaning to me. i lived a very dull life before taking prozac. i didnt really notice any side effects. this drug may not be for everyone but its wonderful for me! it makes me a totally different person, a better person."
1,"within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  after one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  by the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed. side effects included moderate to severe dry skin.  this condition was rectified by the topical application of ""aquafore"" moisturizer. drug was taken in gelatin tablet at . mg per day.  drug treatment was carried out with bi-monthly visits to physician.  after  weeks ended treatment successfully finished treatment.  no recurrence of acne."
0,"by the end of the -day treatment i felt better, but still had major congestion, green/yellow mucus and was coughing up mucus.  the symptoms were milder than before i started the treatment but definitely not gone. i felt no significant side effects - perhaps some slight drowsiness. basically the treatment did not seem to work.  my presumption is that symptoms should have completely cleared up by the end of the -day treatment, but they were still significantly present."

1,"ive been taking tramadol for  weeks now. ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for  months due to cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. i have to admit i loved taking vicodin and percocuet. the problem is that they would knock me out. tramadol has been awesome. it takes % of the pain away and i feel like i actually have energy again. from reading previous comments it sounds like i take a lower dose. im really happy about that cause if i get use to it then i can up my dose and not feel worried about it. i have had no side effects so far. i hope it stays that way. treating for neck, shoulder, arms, lower back, hip, thigh and knee pain."
1,"i immediately stopped having panic attacks.  it really was miraculous, as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  on the combination of klonopin and prozac, i have not experienced a panic attack in  years. i simply feel ""normal"", and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness, which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  no longer did i have to leave work early, avoid restaurants and supermarkets, or worry about getting suddenly ""sick"", for no reason. i experienced no side effects.  i was not tired nor did i feel medicated. i started both klonopin and prozac together.  at first, i took klonopin  times a day.  then gradually i was able to cut back to twice a day, first thing in the morning and again at dinnertime.  i did this very gradually, cutting out first the noontime dosage, and then the bedtime one.  i have never had talk-therapy at all.  i continue to take klonopin, or the generic clonazapam to this day with no adverse reactions at all."
0,"the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit, ie less suicidal, apathetic, morbid, depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help, hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors. here we go.the initial effect would be dry mouth and sleepiness, not being able to think straight or function really but once the dose would be acclimatised it would be okay. but it also cased both hypo and hypersomnia. shakiness at times. large cognitive deficits in reading and comprehension (eyes would literally\ physically play tricks not seeing words or substituting others, blind spots)and a general confusion not knowing what i was doing where i was going.nightmares, nightsweats family doctor initially prescribed wellbutin but a psychologist at the hospital suggested effexor. the dose would be increased as i would adjust and experience setbacks. the gabapentin was added when i had sleep troubles and to augment. many things were also added and subtracted to no avail. a psychiatrist felt the dose could be increased to  mg. so it was but i was not under any supervised care other than my family physician. all the above side effects caused me to be sent from specialist to specialist who all had tentative diagnoses ranging from borderline personality, narcolepsy (the modifinil), sleep apnea and restless leg, and finally bi polar. finally a different psychiatrist said it was the drugs!"
0,some pain relief recieved minimized pain when touched signigicant swelling of hands and feet so significant and uncomfortable that i had to discontinue the medication regimine i started on mg twice aday with out any pain relief.  the dosage was increased to mg twice a day with some pain relief but the side effects began
1,"significantly diminished the symptoms and size of the cold sore.  often, it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two, without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  for my body, valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either famvir, or zoviraz.   it is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores, or are not aware of any new treatments after zovirax. slight dizziness and tiredness, very minor. x mg tablets every  hours for  day."
0,"treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. i did not respond to mg a day as i or the doctor had hoped. but it did allow me to stay focused throughout the day with out drowsiness or fatigue, so i give it a positive review. treatment effectiveness varies among individuals nervousness, insomnia (if taken late in the day) took mg each day in the morning, sometimes if drowsy another mg mid-day

1,"very quick migraine relief with no nausea or drowsiness. other medications (such as imitrex and relpax) had little to no effect, or took a minimum of  to  hours for relief to begin. 

i really like the dissolving tablet, as i can take it anytime without having to find a water fountain or other beverage. relief is very quick, generally within  to  minutes. very mild ""buzz."" this is the first migraine medicine i've found to provide quick relief without unacceptable side effects of previous medications (nausea, severe drowsiness)."
0,the xanax would act as a downer. it would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. if the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. the following day i would have residual sedation. the main complain was the addiction. it was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. it did not hurt but until i took it again i felt not quite content and as soon as i would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. i think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body. as i explained above. addiction and drowsiness. your mind and body felt like you were missing something. until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. you would no longer dwell on the anxiety. once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose i would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.
0,"the benefits were to eventually stop smoking. at first i experienced a slight headache and upset stomache. i was to take  small dosage pill twice a day for  week.  then increase the pill to the regular dose gradually after that week.  the medication is suppose to stop you from wanting to smoke basically by making you sick to your stomache when you smoke. during the first week you can smoke, but the second week you have to stop."

1,"this medicine stopped post nasal drip, itching throat, eyes, and nose. there were no treatment side effects noted. i have taken this medicine once daily, in the morning for at least  years.  it has been very helpful and does not make me sleepy.  it does not, however, last the  hours claimed, which is why i also take benadryl at night to manage allergy symptoms at night."
0,the treatment masked the psoriasis and what was considered arthritis increasing all over body pain i started with  tabs and increased to  as the all over body pain increased and then they were going to put me on prednisone.  i opted to turn to homeopathic treatment and weaned off the methotrexate.  the all over body pain went completely away but the psoriasis was exacerbated.  i'd rather have that than not be able to walk or move.
1,"helped build bone loss. osteoporsis runs in my family. we are thin. two of my sisters were diagnosed with osteoporsis in their early s. one sister fractured her pelvic bone at  from bone loss. i had no side effects. i always followed the directions - take it with water. no other foods or drinks for an hour afterward. don't ly down. i took the drug weekly for about  years. during that time i have had  bone scans. my bone loss subsided. i also drink a lot of diet soda though, and that can effect calcium intake. in the last year i have increased exercising with weights. i am due for another bone scan in the fall."
1,"blood sugar controlled levels around -, blood pressure had been normal ever since i was placed on these b/p medications.xanax was the only one that could prevent anxiety and panic attacks and help me sleep. as for fosamax, i have not had a follow up bone density so i do not know how beneficial it is for treating osteoporosis since i started taking metformin my weight loss continued (this is unwanted weight loss). initially fosamax gave me severe flu like symptoms metformin  mg od, benicar  mg od , fosamax mg q wk,norvasc . mg od"
0,"i have suffered of rapid heart rate for sometime because of my thyroid problem. i was given this medicine to get my heart rate controlled. first few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to mg twice a day, then that was the time i started to feel my heart rate slow down. the medicine is definitely effective but i guess the effect of it depends on the individual as it requres a certain dosage for it to work effectively. i started feeling dizzy whenever i get up from sitting position to standing. i have informed my doctor about this and i was informed that this is a possible side effect of the drug. details as above."
0,the use of premarin reduced hot flashes and kept my skin looking younger. my skin doesn't look good since discontinuation of prenarin. i experienced weight gain and sun sensitivity while taking premarin. i took premarin once daily for over twenty five years following an emergency hysterectomy due to severe endometriosis. i stopped taking premarin because my doctor quit precsribing it.
1,"lovenox is given in subsequent pregnancies to women with recurrent miscarriage due to autoimmune issues.  prior to taking lovenox, i had two second trimester losses and thanks to lovenox i was able to carry my two daughters to term.  it allowed my placenta to last the pregnancy without clotting and i was able to successfully have two children. there are no major side effects.  there is an increased risk of bleeding but i did not experience this.  the only mild side effects was burning at the site of the injection when the medicine was going in, and some bruising at the site of the injection. other than this i did not experience any sorts of side effects what so ever. i had to self administer the shots twice a day.  lovenox shots are primarily given on the belly.   however, the area usually remains sensitive and for anyone taking the drug for a prolonged period of time like i was, eventually you will run out of spots in your abdominal area and have to move to the thigh (i had to move to the thigh area during my last month of pregnancy). other than slight burning and bruising, there was no other issues.  initially i had a hard time giving myself the shot, and my husband had to do it, but once you get used to it, it's not really that bad and i was able to do it easily later on.  i was supposed to start the shots prior to conception and continue them six weeks postpartum.  my overall experience with lovenox is very good and i am very happy that this drug was around to help me."
1,i was severly depressed for weeks and would just cry all the time. i had tried several other anidepressants and none of them worked. one day my doctor said lets try a new drug called effexor xr. i was started on  mg for about  months and was still depressed so then i was increased to  mg and have been on it since. i an so much happier and my family is also. this medicine has been my life saver and recommend anyone depressed to take this one i very vivid dreams but i can live with this side effect to be happy i found that the treatment plan has made life worth living
1,"more energy and alertness, less fatigue & regular normal period duration. periods had been irregular, and often very heavy with severe cramps and clotting. mental attitude improved. i became less tired during the day and required fewer hours of sleep to feel fully rested. concentration improved and thought process seems much more clear after taking the medicine for about four months. none, i felt not ill effects simply taking medication daily"
0,"increased libido. vivid dreams, nightmares, diarrhea, increased anxiety, night sweats, exhaustion. began at  mg, increased to mg after a few weeks.  have not been able to increase further because the side effects are so detrimental.  i am weaning myself off lexapro now and beginning celexa again.  i had a better experience on  mg of celexa and it is far less expensive (because there is a generic)."
0,"the treatmeant benifits are that i showed a slight decrease in wrinkles. i really think that if used with other products it could be better. i also used sunscreen everyday. i really didn't see a difference in the sagging of the skin . i thought it would help with collagen production. i am continuing to use the product. i hope i see a difference. the side effects are dry skin. i can't wax my eyebrows without having the skin peeled off. i know they say to stop  days before you wax but it doesn't help. also, living in florida, my skin became very sensitive to the sunlight. i also get a slight tingling when i apply my sunblock or lotion. i went to my doctor and asked for a wrinkle treatment. he give me some samples of the creame. he then wrote me out a year prescription of the creame. he told me to apply it twice a day but, if my skin becomes dry, to reduce it to one a day. i preceeded to do that and it stopped some of the dryness."
1,"initially prescribed mg zoloft for depression , but after two weeks my condition was markedly worse. i realize that each of us have different tolerances to various substances, and after my gp changed the medication to mg daily of cymbalta my condition started to improve, but relapsed after about  weeks. the assumption was that i had required the higher dose of mg daily, and since taking mg daily my condition has improved to be close to my normal happy self with interests in various things. my advice is to find the medication that 'agrees' with you and stick with it for at least  month. dry mouth. constipation. chewing gum to relieve dry mouth. eating at least  prunes daily for constipation"

1,"the treatment helped the patient focus on her daily tasks and enabled her to 'get going' in the morning.  in turn, the patient was able to exercise daily which also helped her maintain concentration throughout the day.  daily exercise also helped her maintain her moods at a stable level. at first the patient took the medication before she went to bed, which kept her awake at night and did not allow her to sleep.  after a couple of week with inadequate sleep, she sought help and the doctor prescribed her sleeping medication, ativan.  it turned out that the poor sleep was due to taking the medication improperly.  when that was corrected, the patient was able to sleep again and was able to function at a high rate. the patient is being treated for bipolar i disorder, with the most recent episode severe depression.   being bipolar, she is not able to take anti-depressants as this may induce mania.  therefore strattera is an effective alternative which enables the patient to function at a higher level thus treating some forms of depression.  other drugs are taken in combination with strattera to help the patient function at an optimal level each day."
1,"blood pressure medicine lowered pressure and controled very well. starting bp was / to now at / or close to that. thyroid medicine used after partial thyroidectomy due to benign cyst. can't tell whether working on not. this is mostly based on acceptable blood levels. blood pressure medicine has a mild diaretic which causes frequent urination. also some drowiness noticed so i take this at night before bed. thyoid medicine really does not have any side affects for me. tolerated well. i take low dose of prempro each day in the morning. no problems and tolerated well. at first had some breakthrough bleeding but that stopped after a couple of months. positives outweighed. mood improved, less vaginal dryness, skin cleared as well."
0,"infection cleared up but the cough did not. the bronchitis returned and is still present. the z pack was used on  seperate occasions but after the cough mucus was back to a clear color, my physician said i was fine. it is  weeks later and i still have bronchitis and although my coughing is better it certainly is not gone. the side effects were stomach cramps and diarrhea for  weeks. i also took yogurt but that did not seem to help much. the cramps came within  hours of the first dose. it was easy to take but as i cramped so much i am really wondering if i did not take the z pack would i have been in the same place as i am now without the heavy antibiotics. my physician said that i should rest, keep the house at  ' and drink warm drinks. i was very sick with not being able to sleep, coughing as if my chest bones would crack open and without sleep the days were very difficult.

i was not able to function during the day as i was sleep deprived and felt very bad for a week."
1,"stops persistent coughs in  days. non i tend to have persistent coughs after a cold, the coughs would last up to  months. i had been prescribed many cough medicine to treat the coughs, but nothing seen to work. this condition would occur winter after winter after a winter cold. only two years ago my gi doctor diagnozed my condition as associated with reflux, and prescribed kapidex for me to take at the onset of a cough. it works great because it stops my coughs after one month instead of up to  months."
1,"the benefits were great. i really liked symbyax because it didn't give me side effects like the other medication i used to take did. i would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. as i was taking seroquil for my schitzophrenia, i would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though i would take the medicine during the nights! i used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before symbyax and seroquil. now that i'm on symbyax, i'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. so i had a good nights sleep and didn't wake up as tired as seroquil used to make me. :] i didn't really have many side effects besides the medicine making me want to go to sleep. but i'm not complaining, since it does help the voices and the shadows go away for a while. besides that, my psychiatrist wanted me to take advantage of the other side effect, and that side effect is that symbyax might make you gain a little weight. so i wouldn't suggest it to people who want to lose weight. i still didn't seen any change in the weight gain and it was about a month when i started taking the lowest dose of symbyax. now that that month is over, i just started taking a higher dosage and i have noticed an increase in my appetite. i recommend this drug for the depressed ones who are a little underweight and the schitzophrenics. as i was being diagnosed for my bipolar disorder, i would say the medication did more for me than my therapist. the drug, symbyax, made me more calm than i have ever been. it took about a week for the medicine to kick in and when it did, it really did work its magic even though seroquil was pretty good at knocking me out to sleep, it didn't help me with my anxiety and depression like symbyax has."

1,"dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  settled into meridia's program provided over the internet (comes with perscription).  promised myself to follow the rules.  the toughest for me, was not to weigh myself everyday.  meridia wanted me to check only once a week and i'm glad i refrained.  the thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  the strength of meridia has never lessened.  if i forget to take it, i feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and i am in free fall.  it really is strange...  when i take it with my vitamins each morning, it gives me a definite feeling of support.  i am loosing  lbs each week along with inches.  i'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because i have a gym in my home.  i walk  miles/mo. and do free weights.  i also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries, shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  i do eat snacks.  a starbucks coffee (also made at home), with / an energy bar... or, an orange.  responsible eating.  i also understand the dynamics of over eating, being menopausal with depleated hormones.  meridia has been a life saver for me.  thanks to my fabulous doctor, who is also using it. in  mo.

1,"i was having panic attacks and very high anxiety. effexor xr helped to reduce the anxiety and eliminate the panic attacks. my depression is much, much better. i have to take it with food or i get sick stomach. otherwise i have no side effects. you must take a ssri daily. if you skip a few days you start to feel like you are getting a really bad cold, and disoriented. they are hard to wean off of. do not stop taking! talk to your doctor if you feel you want to reduce your dosage."

1,"i was able to live, xanax gave me the ability to face life and dissolve my constant fear there were no side effects as such.. the only one was a build up of resistence to xanax.. years to my consumption of xanax i have build a resistance to it and needed more tablets per day for xanax to have an effect. on top of this i got so severely depressed that i was taking up to  tablets per day, which was twice the allowed daily dosage i was taking  tablets of xanax per day, after  years i was taking up to  tablets per day."

1,"after just three weeks, i felt immensely better and began to enjoy the things that previously i had enjoyed--liked gardening and playing tennis. i also slept soundly. it lifted my mood dramatically, but never made me manic. i also felt more like being with people and noticed that i was no longer so preoccupied with myself or awkwardly self-consciousness. in short, i wasn't depressed and anxious anymore! i gained about  lbs, which was not a problem for me since i'm slender to begin with. there was also some mild constipation, well not really constipation, but a decrease in the number of daily bowel movements. to offset that, i just drank more water. not a big deal. i used this drug after trying wellbutrin, which made me too restless and hyper. it was proscribed by a psychiatrist, who was very well versed in pharmacology, for a depression that came about during menopause. i took it regularly for three years; it completely stopped negative thinking and enabled me to sleep deeply for the first time in several years. i had regular liver check-ups, but never had any decrease in correct liver functioning. after three years, i felt i was ready to cut back on the medication, which i did very, very gradually over the next year and a half so that there was no withdrawal period at all. i've been fine without it now for two years."

1,"after suffering a spinal cord injury in  resulting in quadriplegia (c/c complete), i experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  the problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  i ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and vicodin, just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  however, the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  it also lead to depression.  i was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  it started working almost immediately.  after about two weeks i was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  it doesn't cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the vicodin) so i have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  it also seems to have helped with my depression, although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain, or the side effects of the pain relievers i was taking before. i have noticed very little side effects at all.  i was told it may affect the effectiveness of other pain relievers, but so far i have not noticed that -- when i needed to take a vicodin when my thumb did still hurt on occasion.  i have on rare occasions noticed some dizziness, although i am not sure i can attribute that to the drug (i have low blood pressure because of my spinal cord injury that can sometimes cause that to happen as well). i take the medication three times a day as prescribed, drinking at least a cup of water with each dose.  i was originally taking a smaller dose of the gabapentin, but after about six months my thumb pain started to become more frequent again.  however, my doctor prescribe me a higher dose and that helped.  i do still have problems with the pain from time to time, but not at all like i used to.  all in all the drug has made a huge difference in my life thus far."

1,"i have my life back.  that is the main treatment benefit.

i suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  since taking lamictal at mg for  months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  i have not purged in  months.  this is amazing.  i would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  now i feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, i eat when i am hungry, stop when satiated.  i have lost a lot of weight ( pounds in  months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  i love the lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  i am just a normal person now!  

i also quit the lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  the lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesn't numb the depression like the ssris i have been on.  i feel things.  i am clear-headed.  but i am able to step back and not be hurt by every look i get from people, i am not paranoid anymore, i can wake up in the morning with energy and i fall asleep within  minutes of hitting the pillow.  i get sleepy at pm.  i am not hyper and can sit still for more than  minutes.  :-)

all good for me.  this is the right medication for me... loss of weight, but this was just a result of my mood stabilization as i had developed serious eating disorders. i started slowly and built up as recommended.  i have been very faithful and have not missed  dose in the  months on this medication.  i am now at mg x per day.  i think i will stop at this dosage as it is done its job on me...i don't need a higher dosage.  when i was at mg i was mostly ""fixed"", but still had rage issues and was still impulsive.  that is gone now."

0,"i felt better for the first few days, mood-wise.  but then i got depressed again.  so i guess that's not a benefit. i've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - i have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  when i was told that lamotrigine (the first drug i've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, i decided that this time, i was going to try not to worry.  one out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and i tried to be rational - that means i'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

oh, was i ever wrong.

firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  i wanted to die for two days more badly than i ever had in my life on this drug. it was excruciating.  luckily, i have a lot of support, and i (obviously) didn't kill myself.

i couldn't sleep.  i lay awake most nights until am.  i eventually passed out and got maybe - hours of sleep.  this is barely better than the sleep i get when i'm hypomanic.  and we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  i also had to pee all the time, which was not fun.

that brings me to the rash.
i first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  i thought it would go away, that i shouldn't freak out - i wasn't going to get the rash, right?  and the next morning, i was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  i went to the clinic, and the doctor said i was having an allergic reaction.  he told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  he knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  it got worse, and by night-time i was freaked out.  i called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  i did, and they had me stay the night to make sure i didn't have steven johnson syndrome.  luckily, i don't.  i just have something called ""drug eruption.""

even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  i still am and it's been three days.  i'm afraid to go to the starbucks around the corner.  my verdict?  lamictal isn't worth it.  don't risk it. i was put on .mg, then mg, and we were going to keep raising the dose slowly to minimize risk."

it is very important to begin treatment immediately. hours can make a difference, once the blister has formed, its probably too late and you will have to go through the scabbing and healing process. however, i have found that if treatment is started immediately at first sign of tingling, the blister is prevented altogether. at least, that is my personal experience."

0,"in one year, i only had two periods. my periods before depo were - days and very light, on depo they were longer and heavier. it is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. it was also % effective with preventing pregnancy for me. the first side effect i noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. after this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. i would just cry for no reason at all and i felt like i was going insane. breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. while these side effects were severe to me, the worst is the huge concave i now have in my thigh. while i had a total of four injections, only one caused a huge dimple. it's really embarassing and extremely noticable and i'm not sure why it happened. the doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. this is when i got off depo and switched to seasonique... hopefully, this will work out better. if you don't like receiving shots, this is definitely not the right method. it is a pretty large injection.  however, you only have to endure it four times a month and it's not painful."
0,"the ortho tri-cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. my periods were less heavy, and i did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while i was taking the pills. there are no other benefits to taking the pill that i am aware of. i experienced migraine headaches several times per week where i could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. at first, i had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. they also caused some bloating and moodiness. the ortho tri-cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. i was required to take one pill every day. my understanding is that i experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. i have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne."

0,"i thought the benefits would be one period every  months, pregnancy prevention, regulated periods. i also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. wrong! well i was quite leary about starting seasonique, i was already taking yaz and i loved it, but  periods a year why pass that up. from the moment i started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, i had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. in addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, i didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. it started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) i've even had one on my ribs! crazy! my boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. it was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). i went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. lastly, i've been fretting the last  weeks because i still haven't gotten my period! i never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. the dr. said i would bleed between... still not bleeding! i've taken  pregnancy tests, wasted  bucks on each! oh yeah, i've been crying for no reason at all the last month. i started crying over some lady i didn't even know at work. i do not recommend taking seasonique. i know it must be expensive although i don't know how much because my dr. gave me sample packs and i'm not going to bother refilling it. also they give you a coupon for $ off and $ off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. it wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and i still have no clue as to why i haven't gotten a period yet). i've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. this is the first time i tried one where i only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. if you are looking for a good pill, yaz worked great for me and i never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. hope this helps.  pill every day for  weeks, then  week of period pills"

0,"in theory, my bones should have gotten stronger, as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every  months i first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if i had a brick for breakfast. so i tried the oral solution which, in fact, was better on the stomach but,still, not completely without side effects. most of the days i took fosamax i had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning. i took fosamax for almost  years and after  bone density scans which showed no improvement  i decided to stop the treatment, against my doctor advice which was to take fosamax for at least  years. i believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. it's a big business and i finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones, i believe it is called). i still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. waiting for more research i am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. and to be at peace with myself...  thanks!"

1,"helped me to feel better.  lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  i was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. once i was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  eventually with the combined therapy, i pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (for instance, i can't get up early, during the am, am hours and get to work on time like i use to.  in fact i'm late for everything now which is out of my character) can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like i use to.  otherwise day to day life is manageble as long as i obey my bodies new limitations.
i didn't gain weight or increase in appetite.  i struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat. this drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  when i turned my head left or right, i got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  this lasted for many months. i thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. my psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  i didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  this passed after some months.  i no longer get it.  i felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  i'd fall asleep anywhere.  i don't know if it was the depression, the paxil, lack of sleep, my body trying to heal from stress.  sometimes i felt like i was living life from inside of a fish bowl (from sensory standpoint). i was chronically late to my job of  years for  years straight after suffering this nervous breakdown (due to spousal abuse).  subsequently, i was fired.
when i miss doses of the paxil, especially  or more in a row, i feel like i did when i just started them.  i can barely get out of bed and function.  i'm super sleepy.  i feel drunk.  i'm dizzy.  i will literally go missing for  days.  it takes a few days of regular doses to get me back into my normal mode. initially i was only prescriped paxil and xanax.  i took only these for a few months under my pmd.  dose was increased from a lower one to mg as my depression and anxiety symptoms were still moderately severe, impairing my work performace and other quality of life.  withing a few months i was referred to a psychiatrist for med mgmt. after less than  months, wellbutrin was added to the cocktail at a dose of mg, then increased to mg xl once daily.  ambien was also presccribed as my symptoms did not allow me to fall asleep.  life greatly improved within the next  months to a year.  i weaned off the ambien and xanax completely.  still take the paxil and wellbutrin at the same doses.  also had counseling during all of this time."
1,"the benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free  years after my diagnosis. hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as i begin year  of tamoxifen in my  year plan. the benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. my cancer was highly estrogen-positive. lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits. side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. i had hot flashes that were quite severe. they often came without warning especially at mealtime. i also had some body aches and pains. vaginal dryness was also severe. my period became erratic. after  years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. my period has been non-existant for  months. however, i feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. the effexor helps. dryness is still a problem but not as severe. vaginal odor continues to be a concern. i was put on tamoxifen for  years following my / breast cancer diagnosis. i started tamoxifen /. i started zoloft  months later when i began having mood swings. zoloft helped for a year then i felt my symptoms returning. i began effexor at  mg and have been fine. my oncologist felt i am young and strong (age , exercise  times weekly, runner, martial artist) and that i should try to lower or end my effexor. however, i didn't agree. i needed help with the mood swings and irritability. i can't lose my temper at work. i work with developmentally disabled adults. losing my temper could be my job. i did try a natural regime of vitamins (b- and e) for several months but i felt no relief. friends even told me about my mood. i went from depressed to angry in a flash. the  mg of effexor is wonderful. my estrogen is blocked by the tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel."

in november  i was prescribed seroquel by a urgent care physician. immediately i found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. i did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. i then switched to seroquel xr and found a much more successful experience. i was initially given mg seroquel xr paired with mg lexapro. while initially a good way to stop the mania, i found mg to be too much to function on. i decided to halve my seroquel xr dose to mg continuing to take mg of lexapro. this combo has been great and i am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. i do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. i try to offset this by ensuring that i receive a full - hour rest after administering a dosage. i would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. this year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that i have never quite experienced beforehand. i found that despite the great benefits mentally, the physical side effects are a fair trade.

1,"most importantly, my blood pressure went back down to normal when my heart rate rose to a more normal level. i was then taken off the topral and my blood pressure has remained at a good level. additionally, my hair stopped falling out and wasn't as dry. also, my skin improved. before the medication, my skin was horribly dry and flaky. the changes did not take place overnight. i would say that it took about - months to see any improvement in my hair and skin. i really experienced very few side effects, if any.  initially, they started me off on a very low dosage because they just thought it was simply hypothyroidism but after a blood test, they realized that i has hashimooto's thyroidities and moointored it more closely. at low dosages, there wasn't much improvement in my symptoms. i do have excessive sweating but they aren't sure if that is the synthroid or menopause and the doctors don't really seem concerned. initially i was being treated for high blood pressure and put on topral but they did a tsh test and realized that something was wrong with my thyroid. i was originally started off on a very low dosage ( . mcg/daily) and had to keep going back for blood work every month. slowly they increased it until they did another test and found out that it was hashimoto's thyroiditis. at that point, they increased the dosage to  mcg/daily and so far it has worked out but i do have to keep having the tsh levels checked."
1,"could fairly quickly fall asleep, and usually stay alseep, with little ""sleep hangover"" problem that most other medications result in. i could function in the morning. my general health started improving (fewer flues and colds, headaches, stress and depression, and i had much, much less pain as i started getting regular sleep. some constipation, maybe dry mouth and eyes (not sure if there is a direct cause and effect, but definitely an overlap in timing). about three months ago i started waking up during the night (anywhere from : am to  am) without being able to go back to sleep. have tried numerous other medications and they all had much, much worse side effects that trazodone. i'm not sure what you mean by this, i take trazodone nightly, and have taken it for at least two years. my worst experience from other sleep medications came from ambien (well before my doctor had even heard of the side effects i was having, nor were they listed on the medication or mentioned in the news). i also take cymbalta in conjunction with trazadone, which also supposedly helps you sleep, but the cymbalta alone is not effective for sleep at all for me."

1,the combination therapy worked well but after discontinuation of therapy the condition returned and was worse than previous time. dry skin and occasional nausea i cleanse and apply elocon twice daily to my face and take antibiotics twice a day for  months my face cleared but returned after discontinuation of therapy.  now my dermatologist has restarted the antibiotics orally and added retinoid cream twice a day.
1,"it really helps keep my acne at bay - keeps pores clear and reduces frequency of inflamed pimples, reduces red marks from acne breakouts.  it is less drying/irritating than most other acne topicals. slight itching for the first month or so. i was already pretty clear from going to an esthetician at an acne clinic, but i was just looking for an additional boost to the results i already had.  i previously discovered that i could not use anything other than very mild otc retinoids, as they tended to make my acne flare up.  finacea did not do this.  the finacea was a good addition to my skin care regimen and has decreased the frequency of inflamed pimples and the tiny pustules i sometimes get around my nose.  now i use finacea in the morning, and vivant's derm a gel in the evening, along with % benzoyl peroxide on my more acne prone areas (chin and jawline)."

ps the doctor that prescribed this to me was investigated, tried and convicted of over prescribing, drug dealing and improper relationships with patients.

0,"aromatase inhibitor to reduce recurence of hormone-positive breast cancer- unknown effectiveness- no breast cancer  years after diagnosis joint pain, reduction of bone mass the first drug i was prescribed after a mastectomy and chemotherapy was tamoxifen, which i took for almost  year.  my oncologist said it increased bone mass, so she wanted to use that first to counteract the bone mass-decreasing side effect of the aromatase inhibitors.  their protocol is to use tamoxifen for  years, then switch to an aromatase inhibitor for  years. however, i had some uterine bleeding ( i am post-menopausal) so they switched to femara early. tamoxifen may cause an increase in uterine cancer, which my grandmother had. the most annoying side effect of femara is the increase in joint pain.  nsaids and glucosamine help somewhat but have their own side effects.  that said, i am willing to continue femara for the next  years to help prevent cancer reccurence.  i read in the literature (medscape) that % of women do not complete their  yrs of either drug, and my guess is because of side effects. i take supplemental calcium also to slow the bone loss."
0,"since using the retin-a along with the accutane, i have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  there are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes. it does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall. i use retin-a .% every evening along with  mg of accutane a day.  i will have to continue the retin-a for at least a year."
0,vytorin was prescribed to me to lower my cholesterol. i did not take the product long enought to see a significant drop in my cholesterol levels as i discontinuted treatment. i developed diarrea after taking the ver first dose. i took it for about a week with no decrease in this side effect. i stopped taking it for  days and noticed relief instantly. i then began taking it again and side effects returned. vytorin was prescribed by my doctor for me for my high cholesterol. i took it for about a month and did not like the side effects. from the day that i began taking vytorin i had diarrea. at first i thought it was purely coincidental until i stopped taking it for a few days. the side effects vanished. i took it again and they returned. i told my doctor about this and they switched me to pravastatin ( same dosage) and the same side effects occurred. i then stopped taking the prescription.
1,"i switched from zoloft because the cymbalta wasn't supposed to effect libido negatively.  having ended my marriage and gone through menopause i don't feel i can judge that aspect fairly.  however, i feel the cymbalta is much more effective in keeping the dark cloud off my head, allowing me to be more positive toward life on a consistent basis. dry mouth. i really notice when i miss just one dose; it takes  -  days to catch up, but then i become very aware of negative feelings and apathy.  i am careful to take the dose in the mornings so it doesn't affect my sleep, but have taken as late as pm and not had sleep issues."
1,"slowed hair loss in front and top of scalp.  regrew hair at the back of the scalp and on sides.  it doesn't appear that hair loss has ceased completely for mpb, but increased hair grow in another areas makes my head appear fuller loss of limbido.  my case probably isn't a perfect control because i lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when i began taking the medication.  within  months, started a brand new job and encountered other new stressors.  

i can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of  years.  i would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

i'm overall much happier having thicker hair than i would be with a consistent sex drive.  i am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  instead of wanting sex  times per week, i only want it twice per month now.  again, this is probably a plus i started slowing losing hair when i was -.  the hair loss was unnoticeable until i turned .  my receding hairline started to become very apparent at , especially in my part line.  i began taking propecia when i turned  and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  unfortunately, it appears that i am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

based on my current rate of hair loss, i'm guessing that i will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next - years.  at , i probably won't care how my hair looks because i'll be well out of the dating game.  

i don't think propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but i feel it would be highly effective for others.  anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  the receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.  i may eventually go completely bald regardless, but i honestly feel i've saved - years of youthful appearance."

0,it helped with the dizziness only because it made me so sleepy i couldn't stay up to notice the dizziness! sometimes it would make my heart race so fast i wouldn't be able to sleep at night. this happened about  out of ever  times i took it. it had sedative effects so it just made me want to sleep. it wouldn't have been good for me at treating my dizzy spells while i was at work or in the middle of running errands because i would get much too tired to function safely.
0,"this drug initially provided a modest suppression of appetite. however, within one week my appetite was as great as ever. given that this medication is not covered by insurance, its virtual ineffectiveness is particularly noteworthy. none patient is supposed to take it first thing in the morning so that its time release qualites have the longest impact. one is told that after a month or so you may need to boost your dosage to continue to experience benefits. however, for me, the benefit lasted only  week! not worth it!"

it's been over a year and i can almost qualify as one who has no cravings because they are so, so rare (maybe once every four or five months) and they last for less than a nano-second. 

i'm so smoke free and amazed at two things: . how easy it was to stop because of the zyban, and, . that i ever smoked at all - even though i did for  years. other than being smart enough to finally get the prescription filled, i deserve no credit because there has been no need for any great will on my part. i have absolutely no cravings, no desires, no urges to have to will myself through.  they simply don't happen."
1,"deppression disappeared. anxiety disappeared. since i have been on lexapro i have realised i have been depressed most of my life. i have a very strong family history of major depression. i was in denial to the fact i was depressed. when you have always been depressed you don't know any different. since lexapro i have felt alot calmer and happier. the intense guilt i felt about everything has almost gone. my mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes i had made. i really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now i do. the depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. i am also becoming much less socially isolated, more confident and have began ejoying life. i would have liked to find lexapro many years ago. i started taking mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. when i increased to  mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. i also felt ""far away and fuzzzy headed"" for about  weeks. insomnia was also an initial side effect. after  weeks i am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood. i began taking lexapro for  weeks. i started at mg for two weeks and then increased it to mg. i plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better."

1,"the benefits were having clearer skin between month  and month .my skin did clear but i did still experience some smaller cystic breakouts, which was disappointing. the side effects were minimal and consisted of dry, cracked lips. aquafor did help alleviate that situation. my mood was mildly affected. i did experience some mood swings from time to time. the other downside was having to go do the monthly bloodwork. not having insurance and a tight schedule at work made it a little inconvenient and certainly expensive. overall it was helpful but there is alot involved in being on the drug and the side effects are tolerable overall. i wish the benefits had a longer residual effect or there were some other long term treatments for cystic acne that were effective"

1,"this is an nsri, different from an ssri because it works on more than one brain chemical. when an ssri is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an nsri. this was the case with me. i have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. moving from one to the next as i bottomed out on each. celexa and lexapro being the most recent. when lexapro let me down after a couple of years i was advised to try pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. i was extremely hesitant as i did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness, headaches, possible weight gain, sexual issues, etc. you know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. so i chose to stay on my lexapro and be depressed, hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. wrong. getting to the end of my rope with my depression i finally decided to bite the bullet and try the prestiq. my depression disappeared within  weeks leaving me feeling better than i had in months. i began smiling again and fully functioning doing the things i enjoy and had let slide. my sense of well being and hopefulness for the future returned. honestly, none for me. i sleep, did not gain an ounce, in fact i lost a small amount of weight even though i did not need to, no sexual side effect at all! only thing that was tough was waiting for the dosage level to become theraputic in my system, which as i mentioned took about  weeks. i was instructed to continue on the lexapro at a lower dose for one week. at the nd week add my dose of pristiq to the lower dose of lexapro, at the rd week drop the lexapro completely and continue on my dose of pristiq. this was done while staying in contact with my prescribing doctor. now i take  mg tablet everyday of pristiq, and am doing very well."

1,"my son is generally very leary of any type of medicine and even throws up certain cough syrups and acetaminophens that i would give him.  i had two concerns for this oral medication.  first, i was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  also, being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick, i was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  i found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following, his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective, we continued to take it to the end of the ten days. my son did not notice/experience any side effects.  there did not seem to be any physical reaction with the drug except that he became better within days. i gave my son a teaspoon of amoxicillin after each of three meals per day for ten days in total."

as you can see i have listed a lot of side effects, although to be honest these were not a problem and mostly gone by days of treatment. that is until i got raised to mg and now they are back with a vengeance. 
however, if it helps with the depression it will be worth it. i have my tablet with food as otherwise i get a dodgy stomach, but for some people they may need to take it without food for the same reason. again, if it makes you tired, take on an evening, if it keeps you awake then take on the morning."

1,"the treatmen was very effective as it helped keep pores clean due to exfoliation. the acne deminished after regular use for around  weeks, although it seemed to increase at first. this was expected according to directions. the only side effects were a little irritability of the skin around the nose and eyes. maybe because some product gets trapped in the deeper wirinkles in that area, so must be careful to distribute evenly. i am very delighted with the medecine, to the point where i feel addicted to it and don't ever want to go without it again. my skin feels much smoother, with almost no blemishes, except duting pms times. i also feel like i look younger and healthier due to renuwed skin."

1,"at the onset of my condition of hives, i tried to avoid taking any medications and was hoping to ride it out.  by the second day, the itching got unbearable so i gave in and took benadryl to counteract the severe itching i was having.  at this stage, the hives were in full swing so the medication was only % effective but it helped enough for me to resist scratching myself.  as time went by, the itching slowly subsided and the hives went away (lasted about five days). when i first took benadryl, i took two tablets ( mg) on an empty stomach.  the medication left me nauseated and lethargic. after the initial dosage taken (described above), i reduced the dosage to just one tablet ( mg) but i increased the frequency to one tablet every two hours.  i figured this would be equivalent to the recommended directions of  tablets every  hours but i spread the tablets out to keep the effects of the medication fresh.  i also learned not to take this medication on an empty stomach.  it worked since i did not suffer any nausea, drowsiness, dry mouth, or upset stomach."

0,"it did curb my desire to smoke.  i went from smoking a pack a day after years of smoking to smoking one cigarette a day without using any nicotine substitutes.  however, i never got to the point where i didn't have the one cigarette a day and the side effects were so severe that i had to stop taking the drug. the worst were the terrible nausea, gas and abdominal distress.  i would be so nauseous after taking the drug that i would have to lie down for about forty five minutes before i could function.  also, as the treatment wore on, the gas pains became so painful that i just had to stop taking the drug.  the gas pains grew more severe over time. i took the drug as prescribed but as noted above was not successful at quitting smoking."

0,"treatment was for cystic acne. the dermatologist prescribed erythomyicin for treatment. saw the dermatologist biweekly and the dermatologist would give me a check over. the dermatologist then would ask if i was doing anything different, and then would proceed to give me a new prescription for the erythromycin. the erthyromycin was prescribed for cystic acne. the erthyromycin is an orally administrated drug for the treatment of bacterial infections. gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are fairly common.  although i did not have any vomiting reactions the other disturbances did occur. the treatment with the erthyromycin did not relieve the cystic acne. i was taking the erythromycin three times a day for almost one year and there were no noticeable results. the dermatologist would see me every other week for and check my cystic acne. the medical tech. person would first check me and ask questions regarding any changes in what i was doing and how the medication was working and if there were any side effects.  the dermatologist would then come into the room and check my cystic acne. the dermatologist would then ask if i was doing anything different and then would ask if i was taking my medication and ask if i was on any other medications.  he wouild ask if there were any bad side effects to the medication and then would give me another prescription for another round of medication treatment. this would go on for about one year of visits and prescriptions.  there was not any change in the cystic acne of any great degree."

1,"went from approx.  migraine days a month to approx.  migraine days a month while taking topamax and erinn.  (before adding erinn, was down to approx.  migraine days a month.)  topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude, barometric pressures, humidity levels, environmental triggers such as smoke, strong smells, loud noises, and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  after settling in on topamax these things didn't bother me like they used to. when first starting the drug, diet soda tasted metallic and downright horrible.  there was definitely an adjustment period of getting used to the drug and increasing the dosage in small increments was important.  i could feel changes in my brain that are hard to describe.  almost like the top was a little bit ""lifted"".  it was worth getting through this period for the results, though.  they definitely went away as my body got accustomed to the drug.  once that happened, the migraines lessened and one pleasant side effect was that i didn't snack as often.  no ""mindless munching.""  i lost some weight without trying.  i felt that it was difficult to retrieve thoughts or find the right word at times.  i found it would take a few seconds longer to put my thoughts into words.  felt a little ""spacey.""  as i mentioned before, i got through it after getting used to the drug.  it took several weeks but after having  migraine days a month and going down to  it was worth it. started at mg x a day for several days and started titrating up by adding mg to the evening dose every - days, depending on how i felt.  got up to  mg. a day for the first year.  after moving and talking to my new doctor, she suggested increasing the dose to see if i could have less migraines than the - i was having so i titrated up to mg a day and my migraines went down to  a month."
1,"thought to have allergies - not the case however flonase works to clear the sinuses and prevent infections, works wonderfully!! none at all. after years of trying drugs to relieve what appeared to be allergies and sinus problems, a test was done on the pressure in the ear itself revealing defective eustachean tubes. flonase was prescribed along with claritin d (as needed) to keep any symptoms away as well as prevent patient's constant symptoms and painful infections."
0,"the neurontin slightly helped pain but not enough to contine the drug. it was supposed to help muscle spasms but did not.  i would not increase because of the side effects. made me feel like a zombie, extremly dizzy, nause and major weight gain very quickly without eating any more took  mg three times daily, doctor wanted to increase but side effects too severe.  i could barely function on what was prescribed."
0,"my hair grew back (prior to treatment it was falling out in clumps) and my depression, weight gain, and exhaustion improved somewhat. i experienced no discernible side effects. although this drug did alleviate my hair loss it only lessened my depression,  exhaustion, and weight gain. i still have difficulty with concentration and memory and experience ""brain fog"" every day. my endocrinologist says my dose is perfect based on my blood test results but my symptoms persist."
0,"there weren't any significant benefits. i felt groggy, sick to my stomach and had a general ""heavy"" feeling all of the time. also gave me a mild headache only required to take it once a day with meals"
1,"not so emotional a week before and during my menstrual cycle. relieved thoughts of suicide as well as given me more energy through that rough patch of my pms cycle. feelings have also calmed down with my loved ones. as i can be more relaxed as my anxiety level feels like it's at it's all time low. i can only sleep a couple of hours a night while taking the pill. a day after the last pill is taken, i have a headache for about a couple of days. two weeks out of the month i take  mg, every morning. i start on a sunday a week before my menstrual cycle. finish up the months' treatment  days later.

1,"i started taking premarin after having a complete hysterectomy for ovarian cancer. f
at first, it took about a week to start feeling any effects on the severe hot flashes that i was feeling after being put into instant menopause. but gradually the dug started working and now my hot flashes and mood swings are practically non-existent. none. i started receiving premarin . mg immediately after a complete hysterectomy. after it became effective, i was reduced to a dosage of . mg and it works just fine."
1,"treatment was very effective, effects started to be noticeable after  weeks. after  months skin had cleared and as additional benefits, hair and skin were much less oily (no longer needed to wash hair daily as it was not so oily any more. pores shrunk and much less visible. side effects started about  days after starting treatment. initially lips became very dry and had to use lip salve continuosly. then i started getting nosebleeds as the skin inside my nose became very dry and fragile.
skin became very dry and sensitive during treatment and eyes very sensitive to light.
i had to have regular blood tests to check my lipid profile but it was not affected by the treatment.
during the second course of treatment i also got very mild depression symptoms so i stopped the treatment. i suffered with mild acne and many whiteheads that were resistant to all other topical and antibiotic treatment. my dermatologist was reluctant to prescribe accutane as i had a mild acne but eventually let me try a course at the lowest dose (./mg/kg). i had  courses of treatment with accutane. the first time it was highly effective (side effects were tolerable and worth it as i got great results) so i stopped after  months. after about a year the acne returned (much less than previously) so i took another course and after that it was definitely gone. 
there are side effects but if you can tolerate them, it is a very effective treatment.
i had to do a pregnancy test prior to starting each course and full blood test and had to take oral contraceptives throughout the treatment as there is a risk of birth defects. i also had to see dermatologist every  weeks initially then monthly and have my blood tests repeated.
tretment was very expensive (including cost of drugs, blood tests, consultation fees) but worth it."
0,"none, i was unable to take  the drug to achieve the benefits as i had a reaction. my first impression was of an over all dizzy feeling, with a full body red raised rash which appeared in  days. had to discontinue using, took almost  weeks for the rash to finally dissipate."
1,"i did not see any significant benefits for treating the histamine reaction- which was due to a bug bite and subsequent allergic response.  sensations and symptoms included inflammation, redness, swelling to the point of limited mobility (bite was on hand) and itching, which the xyzal did not effectively treat; however, the xyzal appeared to help with the seasonal allergies related to hay fever.  for the topical condition, diphenhydramine was preferred. drowsiness.  slight dizziness, but not remarkable.  i also thought that the drug's slow-release effect may not be as modulated as one would hope since the drowsiness and related symptoms came in spurts rather than in a constant flow, if you know what i mean.  i did not find that caffeine was helpful to promote alertness and i was nervous about driving while taking this particular medication. i took the every evening every  hours for  days, according to my doctor's instructions.  he did not want me to ""mix antihistamines"" and even though i thought benadryl might be more effective, i didn't want a drug that would make me that sleepy and also that i would have to take every  hours, as opposed to every  hours.  i would have prefferred a xyzal dose that i could take every  hours, and then i could use benadryl at night without worrying about mixing anti-histamines, but since this was not possible i just used the xyzal plus topical antihistamine creme on site of bug bite."

1,"i had a nervous breakdown suddenly and unexpectedly.  after  week in the psych ward, i was prescribed  medications that i soon realized didn't help.  over the course of  year, i tried many different combinations of anti-depresants which didn't work.  not until i tried both wellbutrin and topomax together did i start recovering from my breakdown.  about  / years ago i discontinued the topomax and i've only used the wellbutrin since it helps me maintain my health. i didn't experience any side effects. see above as that thoroughly explains everything."

0,"first days after surgery were a blur.  there was considerable swelling post surgery, and the drug helped me to ignore the way i looked. i was awake but sort of in a daze.  i had plans to do research and reading during my recuperation, but i don't remember doing much of anything for about  days. post laser surgery.  i had fraxel re:pair laser done. i quit the drug as soon as somebody told me i looked like a zombie."

1,"ritalin has saved my life from lethargy and procastination.  i can now focus and be productive.  i am participating in life now ... i wish i would have discovered this sooner.  but later is better than never, i am very grateful this drug exists.  it is not an amphetamine (which is good because i could get addicted to speed too easily), this does not amp me up, it makes me calm and inspired and focused, a huge change in my life.  i am actually enjoying being alive (which is saying a lot compared to where i was at before taking ritalin) absolutely none. i started with . mg x a day and gradually increased the dosage, then to mg  x a day and now i am doing the best at  mg.  x a day.  i will stay here at mg. total for the day.  they say no more than mg. a day but i am happy with mg for now."
0,"it was % effectiv as contraception, the mayor benefit is not having to rememeber to take the pill every day and that it has only one form of hormon, which is important for woman over , especially smokers. the side effects were like a prevision of menopause - huge weight gain ( pounds), incredible mood swings and severe bloating. my overall feeling was quite depressed and it took me a while to figure out that it had to do with the drug, not with what was going on in my personal life. i also thought that the weight gain was partially retlated to quiting smking. one shot in the upper arm every three months, that's it!"

1,"i had the drug initally offered to me by my dermatologist in sample tube years ago.  i found it very effective, despite only dabbing on the smallest amount due to only having small sample tube.  yet despite quick clear-ups...i would occasionally have recurrances under my nose with the rash.  i have struggled with this rash for over  years.  with the last outbreak, while having minimal amounts left in the sample tube, i went in to my dermatologist and got a full prescription in about june of .  not only was i able to use a bit more in application this time, but it obviously was not an expired product.  i found the long-term rash hsf completely cleared up within less than a week.  while this was not new to me with this product, the fact that i have had no recurrance whatsoever in over four months is the great news. absolutely none after washing my face with my long-term personal choice of face wash (alpha hydrox foaming face wash) and using a strident sensitive skin cleaning pad, i would apply the noritate cream sparingly over the rash under my nose at night.  (note:  i did not use the tetracycline during this time, as i knew it was not an acne-related outbreak.)"
1,"during the ten years i've been taking acyclovir, i have experienced zero outbreaks, compared to almost continuous outbreaks prior to taking this drug. i occasionally have the achiness that precedes an outbreak, and have on two or three occasions taken an extra dose per day when i experience that symptom. i have experienced no noticeable side effects during this ten year period on acyclovir. i have no special treatment details except taking recommended dose on time and not skipping doses."
1,"relief from burning associated with reflux slight nausea during the first  hours. part of my treatment plan was to undergo an endoscopy to find out what the problem was initially.  the doctor who performed the endoscopy prescribed the zantac.  in the first  hour period i felt no differently, but the second day i started to feel alot better.  at the end of the two weeks period of taking x tabs per day i felt completely back to normal.  i ceased taking the zantac after my follow up visit with the doctor but was advised to keep some handy for future use."
0,"no mood swings, easy birth control method..it was very convenient not having to take a pill everyday. i had at least  yeast infections while using the nuvaring. i had never had a yeast infection before, nor have i ever had problems getting rid of a yeast infection.   i believe the ring was the culprit. i went to my doctor to complain about the yeast infections.  it seemed like every time i inserted a new nuvaring, i got a yeast infection.  she told me to use monistat, and see if that works.  it worked for a week, but then i developed another yeast infection.   i went back to my doctor/gyno.  she prescribed me diflucan, an antifungal pill taken by mouth.  i was to take  pill every time i started a new ring.  i still had yeast infections.  my doctor then advised me to take the diflucan every other day for  days after starting a new ring.  no improvement.   she then prescribed me a vaginal cream containing steroids and an  anti-inflammatory.   i gave up -  the next time i went to the doctor, i had her prescribe me a new birth control.  i'm back on the pill, loeastrinfe.  haven't had a yeast infection since the switch off the nuvaring."
0,"when i took zyrtec on a daily basis, my allergy symptoms were reduced.  i didn't appear to have the headaches (band around my head) as often nor did i have the pain in the ears associated with this band quite so frequently, my nose was not quite so 'runny' or itchy.  i found my nose clearer during the daytime and i had less 'sniffles' as compared to days when i did not take the zyrtec at all.  overall, it improved my symptoms notably. if i took my zyrtec in the a.m., then by mid-afternoon i could not function.  drowziness, brain-fog, fatigue.  if i took zyrtec at dinner-time it appeared not to affect me.  if i forgot and did not take it until bed-time, then the next morning i could 'not wake up'.  severe tiredness. i discovered that i had to take the zyrtec at dinner-time.  if i forgot and knew i had a busy day or early appointments/meetings, i must skip that day's dosage.  if i don't take it continuously, it is nowhere near as affective."

1,"there has been a noticeable reduction in acne. overall my skin is much smoother. i have sensitive skin and rosacea. it has not exasperated my rosacea like other tretinoin treatments have. i have been very happy with it. it's the best drug i've used for acne so far. my sensitive skin, will still peel regardless but especially if irritated by winter dryness or rubbing against my partner's beard. i have peeled with every tretinoin product i've tried and this is the least bothersome. i am also more sensitive to the sun. unlike other drugs, i have not ever cracked or felt discomfort unless i get excesssive sun or dryness. i don't use it every day in the winter. i spread this on my entire face every night on clean skin. in the winter, i follow with a moisturizer. in the morning, i use metrogel daily. when i have more of a breakout - and it's hard for me to sometimes differentiate acne from rosacea - i will also take oracea for a week. if i know that i will be spending quite a bit of time outside then i will take a break from it."
1,"about two years ago lexapro had totally stopped working and i was trying many different drugs from pristiq, welbutrin, cymbalta, none of which worked. after a few days on welbutrin i experienced the worst panic attack ever. i thought the end was near. i had had them in the past, but nothing like this. it probably lasted only about  minutes but seemed an eternity. the rest of that particular day i was completely exhausted. that was a sunday and the following day my family doctor stopped all my meds and switched me over to clonazepam and zoloft. it's been a year now and i haven't felt this well in a long time. minimal side effects. maybe a little bit of drowsiness from time to time, but other than that nothing else. just visit the doctor from time to time and take klonopin twice a day and my  mgs of zoloft once a day."

1,"prevented unwanted pregnancy.  regular menstrual cycles. none for me. i have friends who hated their birth control pills -- their pills made them feel bloated and fat.  i had none of those side effects while on triphasil/trivora.  it's really simple -- just take one a day -- and pretty effective.  it worked for me for more than  years.  a bonus:  my menstrual cycles, which used to be somewhat irregular, became as predictable as clockwork."

0,"little, if any. minimal pain relief, dramatic sense of disassociation from the pain, agitation. i found that vicodin was a poor choice for real pain management. i felt spacey and ""out of it"" but at the same time agitated.  i didn't feel an actual absence of pain as much as i felt ""oh well, gee gosh, i have pain.  isn't that a bummer.""  in other words, the medication seemed to be more about changing my attitude towards the pain rather then actual reduction of pain.  i subsequently
stopped taking it and turned to tylenol with codeine.  this worked much better in my opinion.  i subsequently refused any additional prescriptions for vicodin and requested tylenol with codeine instead.  i have since switched to a natural pain relief option that is a combination of white willow, feverfew, skullcap, and kelp.  it is called ""relief"".  i believe the manufacturer is ""nature's way.""  although, i am in daily pain for assorted issues (structural) i avoid medicating myself unless it is particularly dibilitating.  if i really need to take something i will take the relief or plain aspirin.  dramatically fewer side effects, no hazard of addiction, just as effective.  given the high level of reported addictiveness of this drug, i would never take it again nor recommend anyone else take it."

0,"started feeling better very quickly. this is some nasty shiznit.  after two days, i began to experience a horrible, disgusting taste in my mouth that made everything i tried to eat taste awful (in a sour, metallic sort of way).  i could even ""smell"" the taste.  it made me want to hurl.  i also developed a rash on my back, neck and face. i stopped taking it.  honestly, the  sinus infection is less unpleasant than its cure. it did clear up the congestion very quickly."
0,"my skin was flawless and i had a very youthful glow. my acne went away completely. my breasts were much fuller and my body looked more curvy and feminine, even though i worked out daily and didn't change my eating habits. the most negative side effect was the mood alteration. i became a completely different person. very depressed and crying all the time for no reason. it was very very strange. not like me at all. my mood would change constantly like a yo-yo. also, i gained weight and felt like i was retaining water. a week before my period i would feel weak and feverish. my obgyn explained that this oral contraceptive uses a synthetic progestin known as drospirenone. he suggested that it might be the cause of my negative side effects. he also said that it was more appropriate for women in their mid-'s or those who have experienced adverse effects from other oral contraceptives. he switched me to ortho tri cyclen-lo and i haven't had any problems whatsoever. i also don't have the benefits either."

1,"i'm using tretinoin to reduce the wrinkles around my eyes. so far i am happy with it- although even as an anti wrinkle treatment improves my skin- i continue to age- so it's an uphill battle. i do my best to take care of myself and had heard that this might help battle the little signs of age on my face. so far i'm pretty happy- nothing drastic, but hopefully continued use will help me to age gracefully and not drastically. definitely some peeling in the first - weeks especially around my chin. i also noticed that applying other products- like facial wash and sunscreen had a slight burning during the earlier stages. i wash my face in the evening, let it dry, and apply the cream. it recommended that i wait - minutes after washing but i generally don't have that kind of time- i think that's to avoid irritation which isn't a problem anyway."

1,"tramadol decreases the severity of pain associated with neck movement. it is not an opiate however it does provide pain relief (for me) along the lines of a mild narcotic without the ""euphoric"" or mind numbing effects. it allows me greater latitude of neck movement. it is very evident to me when the medication is wearing off as i can no longer turn my neck more than approximately  degrees. this drug has been a lifesaver for me and can sometimes even head off my milder migraines. i've personally experienced no side effects other than an occasional jerky type feeling in my movements. i have heard from others that this medication, although non narcotic can be difficult to cease due to withdrawal symptoms. personally i have  had no problem with this. this medication has been known to cause seizures and is not to be taken by anyone who has experienced a seizure. i take two  mg. tablets as needed up to three times a day."
0,"benefits to taking lipitor was that it helped reduce my total cholesterol numbers.  while that was a positive, the side-effects began to make me question the overall reduction in cholesterol numbers. when i first started taking lipitor i did not notice any side effects.  approx. three months into taking the drug, however, i started noticing upset stomach.  at first i thought perhaps the caffeine in my coffee was creating the upset as i started drinking more than one cup daily.  i cutback on the coffee and did not notice a difference in stomach issues.  approximately - months into taking the drug, i began to experience some discomfort in the legs.  as a distance walker i analyzed my workout routine to see if i had added something different but had not.  i quit taking the drug  months (give or take) after starting. treatment was simple:  take on tablet daily at bedtime.  the drug was (and did) to help reduce my overall cholesterol numbers."

i think this is a rather weak way to manage daily pain associated with ic. a little bit of nausea when the pill actually worked.  no side effects at all when the pill didn't work. my ic cocktail started to work after about a month and there wasn't much need for pain killers anymore so i just stopped taking tramadol.

1,my infection cleared up almost before the dosage was done. has not come back. mild upset stomach. i took this once a day for eight days for a vaginal bacterial infection. i only had slight side effects of an upset stomach after taking the pill; probably because i had not eaten  much on those days. my infection cleared up noticably before the treatement was through. i feel it was very effective.

1,"in the beginning of my treatment for type  diabetes, i found the benefits of glucophage or metformin for me to be two-fold.  number one, metformin did seem to lower my blood sugar over a short amount of time in the beginning.  number two, as a medication i found necessary in my life, i have found it fairly inexpensive to purchase as a generic drug. the treatment side effects i experienced were in the beginning.  at the very start of taking glucophage, i had diarrhea.  it did go away after some time on the drug. i take  mg caplets; one in the morning with my breakfast and one in the evening with my dinner."

1,"my total cholesterol level dropped from  to . the niaspan dropped my triglyceride level about  points! the only side effects i had was from the niaspan. i would get flushed and itchy (terribly uncomfortable). the doctor told me to take an aspirin (mg)  minutes to an hour prior to taking the niaspan. the aspirin worked well, i can take the niaspan with no problems. my treatment includes statin drugs and niaspan because normal diet and exercise were not sufficient to keep my cholesterol level down. so, i take my medicine every night without fail, exercise at least x per week and i  incorporate more fruit and vegetables into my diet."
0,"this cream preparation worked well, but over the years i ntoiced it was less effective.  i have used it very sparingly but i no linger use it on my hands becaue it causes seems to worsen the condition of the skin to split the skin in inflamed areas after application.  i use weaker hydrocortisone cream on my hands as a last resort.  luckily that cream is just stron enough to offer some relief. over time (many years) i ntoiced reduced effectiveness and splitting of the skin in inflamed areas (on hands), despite using this product very sparingly. i use this cream as little as possible - only when i have a serious flare-up of the eczema.  when i do use the cream i apply a reasonable amount to the skin - just enough to makae sure some cream comes in contact with all of the inflamed area.  i use the cream once or twice a day during the flare up.  once i notice the inflammation is going down i stop using it- and teh skin finishes healing up on its own without further nedication.  i rinse the cream off my hands after applying becaue it is not helpful to treat eczema on my hands anymore."

1,"quick decrease in amount of acne; improved skin texture. overall, the action of the drug was quite quick and effective, and my acne was resolved within the first  months of treatment i experienced dry skin like many other users of this drug, as well as some joint pain. part of my treatment period was during the winter, during which i was also prone to nose bleeds and fragile skin. i took two mg pills daily following a meal with a moderate amount of fat (more than  grams). the time of day i took the medication varied depending on when i would be consuming a moderate-fat meal."

0,"my cholesterol levels were very high.  te plan was to take lipitor for one month and then see if the levels were lower. no benefits were identified because i could not take take  the medicine long enough to get a second  cholesterol test to measure for measuring any decrease in my cholesterol levels.  after having side effects, i did try to lower the dosage to m by cutting the pills in half, but still felt the bad effects. at first, i did not associate my increasing tiredness and general lack of energy with the medicine. i just thought i was getting sick with a virus. then, as time went on, i started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.  by the time i started to think the way i was feeling might be related to the lipitor, i realized, besides the physical symptoms,  i was in a state of depression.  as soon as i quit taking the pills, all the bad symptoms cleared.  a few days later, i tried taking less (half), but, again started feeling bad. as previously stated, because my cholesterol levels were high, the doctor said i should take lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. but, because i was unable to take the lipitor for the entire month, the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  after taking the lipitor for about  days, i stopped taking it.  a few days later, i did try to take just half a pill.  but within days, the side effects started to return."

i suspect, but am not sure, that yasmin also gave me some vaginal dryness. i had frequent painful sex, would get raw very easily, and actually got a tear inside my vagina from sex. if we went at it twice a day it seemed i would need a day or two break just to recover. (none of this has happened before, so the doctor suggested i move to a lower dose pill.) take once a day at the same time everyday."
1,the benefits of using minoxidil was the halting of dht buildup in the scalp around hair follicles. it also improved circulation to the scalp. this encouraged the recovery of thinning hair to become thicker and fuller. this halted hair loss and restored hair to cover up signs of male pattern baldness. there were no observed side effects with the use of this product. ml minoxidil was applied twice daily to the scalp until the entire dose and been absorbed. treatment was coupled with low light laser therapy - nm w lasers that served to biostimulate the scalp and help in the halting of the effects of dht.
0,"none.  i was told it would take  weeks for the medicine to accumulate and become completely effective.  it did not produce any results that were apparent.  not in inflammation reduction or in pain reduction due to the inflammation were any results ascertainable.  i suffered while waiting for this medication to do anything.  further, you are told to consume food to protect the lining of your stomach from this medication.  not always something you want to do when you are experiencing a lot of pain because pain can make you feel like vomiting. stomach issues, burning  the more adverse affect was the constant pain due to the continuing inflammation with the added and increasing reduction in movement, and muscle usage.  worst, was the waste of time.  another med could have been prescribed in the time i used this medicine that would have been more effective and time healing would not have been wasted.  in fact, another anti-inflammatory was prescribed that provided immediate benefits ( minutes) without the build-up in your system that the m.d. and pharmacist said naprosyn requires before it becomes effective. tried various dosages from the lowest, to more frequency.  it simply had little affect on inflammation or pain.  no other pain medication was added to this treatment and no other medication was given.  i had a car accident and suffered whiplash, thoracic muscle strain, herniation of entire lumbar region, etc.  inflammation was rampant from hip level up.  any relief would have been noted and appreciated.  another drug was later prescribed, another anti-inflammatory, which proved just how much the naprosyn did not work.  i had immediate pain relief in  minutes and notable inflammation reduction very quickly.  in fact, after a  week loading of this drug, i was able to get out of bed, move around, and be functional!  the doctor insisted on trying this level, naprosyn, first and then changed after  weeks, to supposedly stronger medication in some kind of protocol progression.  i now tell my doctors which medication works and refuse anything else.  they waste time on ineffective medications allowing suffering.  i saw the doctors within the  week period declaring and their noting how ineffective this medication was."

0,"there were no benefits. i was repeatedly told it wasn't working because i just hadn't been on it long enough and my dosage wasn't high enough. it did not help the depression at all and it was expensive. trying to slowly reduce the dosages so the medicine could be stopped resulted in very frequent ""brain zaps."" these felt like electrical shocks in the head any time i moved. the electrical shocks could be felt in my arm and chest sometimes as well. the only thing that helped was to lay down and be as still as possible, but even that did not stop the shocks. this went on for  months. the gradual stepping down of dosage was monitored by a doctor and was even done slower than normal but it did not prevent the ""brain zaps."" headaches and some nausea also accompanied the shocks. started with mg and gradually increased to mg. after a year of treatment and no improvement the drug was eventually decreased and stopped."
1,"very heavy smoker.  was able to reduce smoking to half pack per day in the run up to totally quitting.  then was able to quit. skin itching; insomnia, strong urine smell; weight gain the side effects, aside from the weight gain, were tolerable enough to enable me to quit.  i have back slid a couple of times and found taking the pill for a few days resolved the problem.  it has been a year since i first started taking the drug."
1,"complete relief from pain with one  mg tablet. alleviated the sensitivity to light, noise and nausea. symptoms would abate in one to two hours. a little ""fuzzy headed"" until it took effect. this is taken as needed. it works best to take at the onset of the migraine and not to wait to see if will go away."
1,my heartburn greatly reduced and i could sleep at night so the gerd was successfully addressed. very frequent and bad dysentery. stomach cramps were also an issue and if those side effects could be eliminated this would then be the perfect gerd relief drug.  pill twice a day with meals with lots of liquids.
1,"my doctor has this combined with hydroxozine and i feel wonderful.  i have taken paxil, lexapro and a few others since i was about .  i would def. say that this drug combination has worked the best.  the first two weeks i experienced withdrawls from my other med(lexapro) but after that, i am great and back to new :) for the first couple of weeks i had withdrawls from prior medication.  but that is all i have experienced. i believe that this, and the hydroxozine are a miracle drug combo.  i have suffered from anxiety since around age  and i finally have a ""normal""  life."
1,"treatment benefits include clear, glowing skin, regular menstrual cycles, and reliable birth control. treatment side effects include breast tenderness for about a month after first doseage, and some ovular soreness. treatment details include taking a pill eachday at the same time for maximum effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, and taking the  placebo pills to help remember to take a pill every day."
1,"the prickly heat would be cleared up over night. the itch would disappear within a few hours the bumps would loose all redness but would remain slightly raised for a couple of days i had no side effects at all, but as i need to write  words it may also be worth noting that i had the positive effect of the painful achilles tendon i had also disappeared after taking the tablets for  days as soon as the prickly heat starts i had to take  tablets daily for a maximun of  days i have never had to take the tablets for more than  consecutive days"

1,"differin has practically eliminated my acne.  i also used it on my forehead, where i have brown spots from a college-days sunburn (appx  years ago).  the spots have clearly faded, though are not completely gone. side effects were peeling and some redness, but only occurred the time that i used too much differin.  i knowingly put more than prescribed on my chin in hopes of getting rid of an outbreak before vacation.  the redness and peeling was very noticeable. treatment includes adding only about / pea sized amount to my chin area and the same amount to my forehead after cleansing at night.  this i do daily.  i combined this with a regular alpha-hydroxy exfoliation night creme (applied after the differin dries) in order to catalyze (by my own approximation) the skin rejuvenation/renewal."
1,"my father became extremely depressed following his mild stroke. about  weeks after we increased the dose from -mg, there was a significant change in his attitude and he embraced life again. occasional light-headedness. after his mild stroke, my dad could not continue his previously active routine. he hated not being able to drive his new car to meet his friends for their daily breakfast. he was always on the go, even at home he was constantly puttering with gadgets & watching stocks on the computer. all of this had suddenly been taken from him and he was angry & frustrated that he was unable to do these previously simple tasks. depression set in and he just gave up on life. he would even dream that he was dead. he cried & moaned a lot (my dad never cried before). i was pleased with the results from this medication."
0,it did help alleviate the depression unfortunately it caused me to gain  lbs in less than  months...i have been on many different antidepressants and this one was the worst when it came to weight gain daily dose of medication...it helped alleviate depression symptoms but caused weight gain
0,"eased my anxiety, helped me start going to work more. this drug was extremely difficult to start. i had headaches and dizziness for weeks. also caused digestive problems - bloating and flatulence. had no energy - before i took this drug i was a very active person but once on it i had no energy to excercise. also craved sugary and carbohydrate rich food which ended up giving me thrush and other fungal infections. caused concentration problems. i stuggled to concentrate on my work for a full day. i also felt very flat. am stopping this drug and going on to paroxetine again as the side effects outweighed the benefits."
0,"it was very good in controlling the panic attacks. before taking it i was even unable to drive my car down the road without having a panic attack. i worked liked magic from the very first dose. i could resume to being close to feeling like a normal person again.  it worked well for panic attack prevention. there were no real side effects other than a dry mouth. i still suffered from some anxiety symtoms such as feeling a bit nervous restless, sometimes had trouble sleeping. if i drank alcohol at the same time in small amounts, i felt even better and seemed to have no bad feeling at all but that was short lived, and as i found out later on also dangerous. and just don""t ever stop taking it suddenly. thats also very dangerous. the treatment was to take three  mg tablet a day, with food. the trouble was that i became very reliant on the medication and felt i needed to keep taking it. then one day i decided to quit and i just stopped taking it. i don""t know why i did not  slowly wean myself off over a couple of weeks. over the course of the next three days i never got out of the house i was sick, shaking uncontrollably, having hallucinations both audial and visual i thought i was going to die. i felt like  hell. a friend found me and took me to the doctor. it was the worst feeling i have ever felt in my life it was the withdrawal symptoms from the drug. all i needed to do was take more, but i felt to afraid. to this day i cant tell you why i just could""nt think straight."
1,my acne has definatly cleared up and my period is so much better and lighter. unlike all the other adds i had absolutly no bleed through. i have gotten migranes since i was a teenager and since starting this pill i feel they are more likely. i really like seasonique. i love only having four periods a year
0,"none.  vicodin is a narcotic for severe pain. i was prescribed it after weeks of physical therapy and ibuprophin did not reduce the pain in my shoulder and neck following a ski crash. much to my dismay, the drug made me feel extremely nauseated. though i did not actually throw up, i felt like it for a day. furthermore, the pain in my neck and shoulder did not improve. even if it had, i would have discontinued vicodin anyway. my doctor did not mention any possible side effects, nor did he tell me it is a narcotic. apparently, it is a drug of abuse. also, nausea is a common side effect. i was only told that it was a pain killer that would alleviate my discomfort."
1,"the sores disappeared much sooner than with regular treatments (acyclovir) and the pain disappeared the next day. due to my chronic gastritis, i had minor stomach aches but nothing too bad the treatment was started on the second day of the sore outbreak, and i noticed the effect very quickly: the next day i felt barely any pain and the sore disappeared much faster than usual (about - days overall vs the previous - days)"
0,"well it was supposed to stop my painful periods from my endometriosis and its suposed to stop my endometriosis from growing. depression, nausea, anxiety, heart racing, still in pain, still having painful breakthrough bleeding. well ive been takin it everyday for  months and if one more doctor tells me ""its gonna take some time"" im going to break something. i start college soon (again, had to drop out due to my painful constant periods) so im getting real tired of feeling like dirt all of the time. its supposed to make everything better and it hasnt done jack crap. i also have to take opana for the pain (morphine pills) and im going into medical school and they dont like drugs in youre system"
1,i sometimes get hives or sinus type allergies.  when i take this anti-histamine i notice that it works quickly and is very effective for hours.  i never get sleepy like i do with most other over the counter anti-histamines. i did not notice any side effects. one small pill a day is all it takes to relieve my mild to moderate sinus allergies and occassional hives.
0,"decreased nausea, dizziness when standing, pins and needles sensation. eyes and skin less sensitive to sunlight. extreme sleepiness (mg feels like i took a tylenol pm). slight inability to concentrate. depression of mood, slight irritability. i have noticed some suggest this is also prescribed for anxiety, i haven't noticed any reduction in anxiety, i have noticed if i'm irritated the irritability seems to last a bit longer than normal. it has done nothing to increase my motivation or productivity. i already have a low heart rate, so an hour after taking it i always take mg caffeine +  primatene tablets (mg ephedrine hcl) to raise heartbeat while the atenolol stabilizes it. the ephedrine also helps to counteract sleepiness and depressed mood atenolol causes in my system. i was going to quit taking it but over  months i have slowly experienced an increase in my health, before i was almost bed-ridden, now i can get up and walk around for extended periods of time. i originally had a bad case of mono a few years back and it still showed in my system, he said it probably caused a bad case of chronic fatigue but it is not considered a real medical condition, so he wrote me a script for atenolol after my ekg. they took  ekg's that read no heartbeat and the th read a supposedly impossible wave, i did every test from two separate doctors, they have no idea what it is."
0,"i did see improvement in numbness and tinglng in upper extremities. helps marginally for sleep. poor concentration, drowsiness, dizziness, memory problems. my physian tried to titrate dose to mg per day. the side effects were intolerable to the point that i was having prolems at work. i currently take mg hs. i plan to discontinue this medication as the side effects are not worth the marginal benefit"
0,"when i first began taking the ritalin, i noticed a dramatic effect on my mood.  i felt wonderful!  i was energetic and positive and i felt that i could handle anything that came my way.  i don't want to sound as though i felt euphoric or manic - i just felt really good about life.  however, after only a few days, that sense of confident well-being drained away. initially, the medication kept me awake all night but that only happened for a night or two.  i take them on an empty stomach in the morning and sometimes my hands shake very slightly for a while but it's not enough to cause any problems. my psychiatrist put me on it to 'give a boost' to my other antidepressant.  he says i am taking a miniscule amount, and that i could increase the dosage if i wished but i have been reluctant to do so.  perhaps i should - i may not be taking enough to be effective but i am on three different antidepressants and i feel uneasy about sharply increasing the ritalin dose.  in short, initially, i felt great but now i feel just the same as ever - struggling with the thoughts that cause lack of energy & enjoyment in many spheres of life."

1,"my anxiety when driving was lowered. none one day i was driving on a freeway (, san francisco bay area) and felt like i was going to faint.  it was a clear day, not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one, .  i pulled over to the shoulder so i could compose myself.  i felt like i was having a panic attack (which i had never had before but friends have) so i took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  when i felt i was alright, i returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before i reached home.  i have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. after it happened a few more times, i put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where i had no problems.  when i went to my doctor, i told him about my anxiety and he prescribed paxil for me.  i began taking it and, it took a while, though i wasn't ready to try the freeway right away, but it has definitely helped. i am now more willing to just get on the freeway.  i have not noticed any side effects from taking it or changes in my personality...i did not need it for depression or any other anxiety but freeway driving."
0,"the benefits were that the infection was eleminated. the infection had apparently grown over a period of several months and then reached a point that it suddenly was accute. i say it grew slowly over several months because my abdominal area, even as far up as including my waist, had grown from about  inches to about  inches and i required clothing two sizes larger. i had become more and more weak but thought that it was my age (even though up until a few months before the swelling started i was still hiking up to  or  miles a day in the andes in chili or in the canadian rockies. weakness had suddenly become so accute that it was causing my heart to labor so much that radio-active dye x-rays were taken of my heart. my abdomin had a sonigram to see if i had ovarian cancer. the metronidazole  mg and the ciprofloxacin  mg wer prescribed one tablet of each twice a day for two weeks. however, after several days i began to have slight light headedness, tingling in my fingers, much short-term memory loss, and constant whistling in my ears. by the sixth day these side-effects had intensified to the point that my hands were shaking, i was dizzy, and the doctor told me to discontinue the meds.eleven weeks have passed and i still have constant whistling in my ears, my short term memory has improved but has not totally returned, and my bowels still do not work without taking a stimulant. i am taking probotics ( mg each, billion total microorganisms per capsule twice daily), eating such as activia daily, etc to try to repace the healthy bacteria level in my intestines but as stated earlier this is not yet accomplished. i am very tired of hearing the constant whistling in my ears. this may be covered in the treatment benefits section,  the prescribed dosage was  mg (along with ciprofloxacin  mg) both twice daily for two weeks: however, by the sixth day the side effects were severe enough that the doctor told me to discontinue taking both the metronidazole and the ciprofloxacin."
0,"none!!!!! i began having very irregular heart rhythm within about  / weeks of taking this medicine.  feeling like i was going to pass out or maybe my heart would even stop beating. i began having very irregular heart rhythm within about  / weeks of taking this medicine.  i began feeling like i was going to pass out or maybe my heart would stop beating & i would just keel over & die if i didn't immediately start moving around. i could be sitting or laying down in bed & these ""spells"" would come on out of the blue & very regularly.  i spent one night up all night laying on the couch because it was so bad that i was afraid that if i fell asleep i might not wake up. i tried to pretend it would go way at first but then made an appointment with my dr. first & then a cardiologist, it was just too scary. my dr. didn't believe that it was the medicine. by the time i could get in to see the cardiologist & have the heart monitor holster, echocardiogram etc. done i had been off the medicine for  weeks & the symptoms had lessened & of course did not appear while i was being tested. the dr. thought i was crazy & that there was no way it was the medicine & that maybe i was having panic attacks.  i have never had a panic attack in my life & i have had similar heart rhythm symptoms with other meds that quit when i stopped taking them & i know my own body.  it was the lovastatin.  it took a year & a half before i started feeling normal again & didn't have these attacks come on sometimes.  i truly believe the lovastatin had an affect on my heart that took that long to get better. i will never take another cholesterol med again that has the possible side affects of affecting muscles.  the heart is a muscle.  i also found that other people have had this same experience while taking statins while i was researching this on the internet.  neither dr. would even look at the article i printed out about it & it was even written by another dr. who was researching statin side affects."
1,"shortened time span of cold sore. 
sometimes alleviating symptoms entirely. none if you take one pill as soon as you feel the tingle of a cold sore coming on, often it will not even appear at all. i know you might think, ""maybe there wasn't really one in the first place."" but if you get cold sores regularly, you know. sometimes if i couldn't get to the pills right away and a cold sore did appear, i would take a total of - pills in the course of the next  hours, and the sores would often be gone within  days instead of the usual . if you can't get to the pills within the first  hours, there is really not much good they can do after that, from my experience. this drug is kind of expensive--if i recall from before i had insurance, it was $- for a bottle of zovirax, but now they have a generic form so it is probably less. regardless, this drug is worth its weight in gold."
0,"while on the drug i did not have any large, red acne lesions. lupus-like symptoms that were very severe:

severe joint point

iritis flared again  months after stopping the drug after i turned  my skin changed.  it became much oilier and i started having large acne lesions again around my chin.  this was especially true before a period or when i was under stress at work.  i decided to see a dermatologist as i was sick of the acne.  i started yaz which was alright, as well as retin-a.  this didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed solodyn.  looking back now, i think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks, i just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  i thought i was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  i was just about to go to an orthopod when i decided to investigate the solodyn more.  i read about the joint pain and lupus-like symptoms, stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  she did some bloodwork and i had a positive ana blood result (mid-positive, not low).  this is one indicator of lupus.  my dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  i called the office again a week later as i was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  i got a phone call back that basically said ""hello, hypochondriac, you do not have lupus.""  then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  i went to my gp who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and i started  weeks of drops.  she also referred me to a rheumatologist who ran a number of tests and told me she's seen minocycline drugs do this to people a lot and she would never take one or have her children take one - great.  that's my saga.  now dealing with another iritis flair up and a lot of pain in my left knee,  months after stopping the drug.  please don't take this drug!!!"

1,"yes very beneficial, although i will discontinue using the cream on face every night and maybe use every other night, until my skin adjusts. i also use the cream on the back of my hands and decollete area, love the results! i can see a huge difference in my hands already (probably about  month of consistant use) i have a few small sun spots that have lightened significantly, the skin on the back of my hands appears less elephant like ( tough, rough, wrinkling skin) and now appear more smooth, radiant and even toned.my decollete area has also seen great improvment, again more even toned, smooth, i have not seen a great deal of tightening, but i am very happy with the results thus far--- about  month of consistant use. some redness and peeling around the outside of my eyes and upper lip. caused sensitivity when using other products....night creme, serums and sunscreen. i have read that these side affects are normal and part of the skin adjusting to the retin a.....after all that is what it is supposed to do...create a chemical change in the cell which promotes cellular turnover resulting in newer, firmer skin. daily apply about a pea size amount of the creme on my hand and sparingly apply to the orbital area, lips and forehead. i add additional creme to the back of my hands and rub vigourously ( rubbing the back of my hands together). i also apply a dime size to my neck and decollete area also rubbing, but not as vigourously. i generally do this every night after i cleanse, tone and add serums ( for pigment relief and building collegen) if i am feeling especially dry after applying the tretinoina,i will also add a moisturizer."

0,the benefits were the prevention of seizures following brain surgery initially after surgery i was given dilantin injections which were very painful. it felt like concentrated acid was being injected into my vains with a painful burning sensation that lasted several minutes after each injection. after  weeks i was changed to oral dilantin (mg  times daily). so no more painful injections. as mentioned above i was prescibed dilantin to avoid seizures following brain surgery. i was given dilantin injections for a period of  weeks while in hospital and then it changed to taking oral dilantin (mg  times daily)for a year. during the year i had one seizure after  months which happened on the night that i felt well enough to have some drinks with my friends for the first time since the operation. i didn't drink again for the following  months while on dilantin and did not have any more seizures. i stopped dilantin after  months and have had no seizures since

0,"helped somewhat in minimizing the cravings and anxiety while taking it but still required substantial will power to quit.  considering the absolute hell i went through to quit i will probably never go back to smoking. acute nausea, mental fog, vivid dreams, poor sleep quality, sore eyes, constipation, uncontrollable flatulence, euphoria, turned to dark depression, psychosis nos, major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, self detrimental behaviour, emotional lability, agression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, somatoform disorder, delusional parasitosis, cholinaergic prurritus, hyperacusis, severe sleep depervation; excessive dreaming, inability to sleep deeply, feeling half awake while sleeping, waking up with sore eyes., brain fog, lowered inhibitions, hair roots hurting, excessive hair loss, irritable bowel syndrome, puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, inability to feel orgasm, decreased ability to maintain and achieve erections, anhedonia. i took champix in march of ' and i am still suffering from most of the side effects of this poisonous drug.  i started to feel some of the bad effects (nausea, mental fog, trouble sleeping, sore eyes, constipation, gas) of champix while taking it but i was determined to quit smoking.  for the first month i felt exceptionally good and i was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and i went into a deep depression.   i was able to make it through the full  month course but when i stopped taking it is when i really got messed up. i developed psychosis nos, major depressive disorder, suicidal, emotional instability, aggression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, somatoform disorder, delusional parasitosis (bug crawling sensations all over my body), hyperacusis (sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound causing severe pain and pressure in my ears), severe insomnia, memory loss, brain fog, lowered inhibitions, hair was constantly hurting all of the time and lost lots of it ( year old male), irritable bowel syndrome (started as extreme constipation and gas, fatigue, severe eye pain, unsightly puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, black out and become out of control when drinking, decreased sexual pleasure and ability to maintain erections. i think that is everything!!! i went to the psych ward recently due to being suicidal and at a breaking point with my symptoms and i was treated like scum and given brain damaging neuroleptic (anti-psychotic) drugs against my will. i have made some small improvements since taking champix but it looks like the nightmare will never truly end. if you are one of the many that gets burned by this medication be warned that the doctors will probably not be able to help you and will most likely deny that anything is even happening to you or that it is related to champix and the side effects may be permanent.  i had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking zoloft when i was younger which altered my life substantially and now champix has put the nail in the coffin.  apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  the medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  many people including myself (i turned down a prescription of zyban due to my experience with zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and pfizer knew that.  shame on them for ruining my life and many others including those whom ended the misery by taking their own life.

    i am pleased to say i haven't had one side effect of the drug beyond a sticky spot left by the patch's adhesive. granted, it has only been  months since beginning treatment but the benefits and quality of daily life restored have far outweighed the risks. it is, to my understanding, the smallest dosage available at / and my doctor suggested i even try applying once, rather than twice per week to see if that was enough to handle my symptoms. it was. the patch is so easy. i only have to remember once per week to change it. and on the rare occasion i forget, the patch loses some of its stickiness and reminds me! honestly, for any woman truly suffering from constant problems like mine and don't fall into a high risk category, i would wholeheartedly recommend the patch."

a positive side effect was that after the treatment was over i noticed that the skin on my legs was very smooth. previously i had rough, scaly skin which i just thought was dry skin, though i could never rid myself of it. but i guess it was part of the whole problem because now the skin is beautiful. i had been having regular doctor check-ups and am healthy.

1,"improved mood after trying several other ssri's. had tried prozac and wellbutrin and got no effect from them. i was able to function better. i was not ecstatic, but was functional and less prone to negative thinking. a bit of feeling dull or neutral. maximum dosage indicated in literature is  mg per day.  took two  mg capsules in the morning with breakfast. the medication started to work within two or three days.  however, it's expensive. i would not say that i am non-functional without it, but i believe i am more functional when taking it."
1,"cleared up my acne and brightened my skin overall; slightly reduced fine lines.  aside from acne, it seemed to help my skin in general.  this is by far the best acne treatment i've used.  now i use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne). thinning of skin leaves more sun sensitivity. also, it cleared my acne, but didn't seem to ""treat"" it - if i stop using it, my acne comes back within a few weeks. very easy - simply applied a pea-sized amount every other night before bed."
1,"i have been on paxil or generics for  years after a life-time of panic attacks. my attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment i would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. as a few others have noted, the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. i am a calmer and more socially comfortable person. lots of side effects, none of them deal breakers. it took months to achieve orgasm - it was like having a dead weight between my legs. having reduced treatment to mgs a few years ago that has improved. as many others report, wild dreams and less deep sleep is now the norm but i have long grown accustomed to it. miss a dose and you get those weird 'electric' buzz shocls in your brain - a tad alarming but not horrible. weight increase of about  pounds - very difficult to get rid of. started at  mg on doctor's recommendation, went to  after a month. noticable improvement in mood and lessened anxiety. after - years weaned myself down to  mg by cutting the pills. with doctor ok have stayed at  for the last  years. once i tried to reduce it to  mg - big mistake. too big a jump and had terrible anxiety. decided i could live with  mg. it works, but with side effects. like all powerful medicine, it's a tradeoff. for me it is still worth it  years later."
1,it seemed to help with the joint inflamation. some swelling of ankles was reduced and i didn't seem as achey. i tried several sample medications first like celebrex but i liked the mobic best. i have not gone off of it since i started to really know if it makes a difference. none took one mg tab a day.
1,prevention of pregnancy. i used to insert in my vagina the nuvaring and i had my period just in time. i always knew what day my period was coming. headaches..cramping..nausea...dizzines one ring once a month. i had to keep the ring for three weeks in my vagina and then take it out to get my period three days after. i had to insert a new ring in the fourth week.
1,"immediately ameliorated symptoms and extremely efficacious when used prophylactically occasional mild gastrointestinal irritation when using a high dose ( mg) i take  mg of acyclovir at the first sign of tingling along lips or tip of nose. i've found this prophylactic approach to be most efficacious if i dose at  mg for a day or two subsequently. in doing so, i've reduced hsv outbreaks from one a month to one a year. if i do get an outbreak, i dose  mg per day ( mg apprx every - waking hours) for four days then taper to  to  mg per day for two to three more days with excellent results. if i begin dose after an outbreak has initiated, it is immediately arrested from worsening though it still will go through it's viral cycle remaining at a very small scale as long as i continue treatment as described above."
1,marked adjustment in level of depression within one month. continued benefits through following years of usage. no side effects were experienced. wellbutrin xl was used in conjunction with talk therapy to great effect. dosage has been maintained over the years with frequency of talk therapy decreasing and alleviation of depression has been maintained.
1,"it works great, no asthma symptoms. but i'm loosing a lot of hair, there's mild  pain in my lungs and legs on a regular basis and  mouth infections. i'm was diagnosed with asthma  around six months ago  after getting pneumonia that lasted  months. i did have allergies before but never  any asthma symptoms."
0,"improved exercise tolerance. stopped coughing up blood. improvement in chest pain. nausea, bad dreams, very prone to sunburn. for the antibiotic to be effective i need to take a relatively large dose for my size (kgs). have to take anti-nausea medication while on the course of antibiotic otherwise tend to lose weight. have had repeated courses of this antibiotic over several years. sometimes it works and other times it doesn't but the infection always recurs within a few weeks of stopping the treatment."
1,"drug did take away pain quickly; easy to take, not contraindicative with muscle relaxers or codeine allergy. no pain but very loopy.. drug made patient incoherent and confused; bad memory and constipation patient had crazy ideas. take for pain,  pills every - hours, no more than  in  hours."
0," periods a year the first week that i took this pill, i felt like i had the flu.  i had to take a sick day off from work because i felt so sick: headache, constantly feeling hot and cold, extreme tiredness.  i also started breaking out a lot and my skin started to be so dry.  my husband also has said that i've had some mood swings as well. i stopped taking the pills today.  i hope this will stop all the symptoms.  i will probably never take any birth control for the rest of my life.  i was on depo for about  years, which was fine--no major side effects except for the decreased sex drive.  i was on ortho tri cyclen for about a year before depo, but i stopped because i definitely got lighter periods but the periods were longer ( days) than when i was not on any bc ( days).
i shouldn't have been on any bc to begin with.  afterall, i shouldn't complain--my periods are always on time like clock work.  no cramps, only the occasional bloating.  i started to be on bc to prevent pregnancy, but i'll just be more careful by using a condom instead."
0,"i took vicodin for pain in my wrist but i had to stop because it would give me a headache everytime i took it. so i can't really say there were any benefits to it, because eventough it helped with the wrist pain, the headaches were worse. see above this was prescribed by a physical therapist. i was also receiving the physical therapy for my wrist pain, which was from work related injury.(repetitive overuse). the pain killer was to help with the pain from just moving my hands."
1,"with the topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, i lost about % of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. it was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and i just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. not that food didn't taste good, or i wasn't hungry, i just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. so when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss. dry mouth (i was also taking prozac at the time which definitely contributed), mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles), i've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with topamax (i.e. dopamax), they forget words easily, have trouble spelling, feel foggy, etc... i guess i'm one of the few fortunate people whom topamax doesn't effect that way. either that, or the dose i'm at ( mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to mg. i had done some research on topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines, and it was only fda approved for epilepsy. while on the web i found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes, such as an add-on to an ssri that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients, a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder. several convincing clinical studies have been done in all of the above categories as well. topamax will have clearance from the fda to be marketed for the treatment of bipolar disorder in ."
1,normal thrombosin level within  weeks none  pill every morning
0,"this medication helped me marginally to focus better and was somewhat more energetic. i did not had much side effects, had some dry mouth at times but was manageable. i started with low dose with  mg dialy, gradually increased upto  mg. did not hv satisfactory results but my psychiatrist did not feel comfortable to increase the dose due to serious drug abuse potential though i absolutely hv never tried as illicit drugs including the most commonly used mj and alcohol."
1,"no headaches and better quality of life  great at treating headaches nervous system overhaul, dry mouth, stiff neck used as needed  no healing- just treatment  the medicine was very effective at treating headaches as needed but provided no preventative help  still had them just as frequently but was able to rid myself of them"

1,"heartburn was usually decreased significately if not totally none i get heartburn caused more from my condition than from food. there were times that i had ""breakthrough"" heartburn even after using prevacid. i generally don't even use the prevacid now. i do try to not eat things that will cause heartburn but i still get heartburn often. i take the ranitidine often, but not every time i have heartburn. there are some times when i will take one or two tums to get a jumpstart against the burning."
0,"i felt a bit calmer and had a little less mania, but it did not help much. upset stomach, low appetite, metallic taste, tremor i was given lithium in order to calm my manic thoughts and depressive symptoms along with psychotherapy. i did not notice much improvement from lithium.
it did come with unwanted side effects such as persistent tremor and
upset stomach. i would like to try another medication."
1,"it lifted my depression without any noticeable side effects which i had experienced with every other anti-depressant i had taken. none. i had been prescribed  mg which is a normal dosage, but fond it made me sleepless.  so after talking with my doctor, we agreed to let me try half the dosage.  i'm especially sensitive to medications and always feel overdosed at the 'standard' dosage. 
i've been taking wellbutrin for the last  years and only recenyly felt the need to boost it up to  mg as the depression seemed to be inching up. it worked for me and i will maintain the  mg through the winter months. 
i think this is a wonderful drug, if nothing else works for you, give it a try."
0,it was supposed to stop the hot flashes that were keeping me awake at night. left me extremely sleepy the next day to the point i had to lay down an hour after i got up and i noticed no real difference in the hot flashes. i wanted to stop hot flashes without going on hrt medication.  my doctor recommended trying clonidine
1,"i had become unable to drive any further than / mile to my job and no further without suffering serious anxiety attacks.  after a little over a week on the medication, i was able to drive in heavy traffic, and basically anywhere i needed to go.  my life has become my own again none i only had to start taking  tablet a day, and after a little over a week, i could definitely tell a difference."
1,"it helped me sleep, which at the time was miraculous. bad taste in mouth but the sleep was worth it. if i could tell i was going to have a hard time sleeping, i was supposed to take the medecine about  minutes before going to bed.  sometimes it was hard to realize/remember to take it ahead of time like that, but it was so fast-acting that wasn't really a problem.  i'm little, ' and  lbs, and the doctor said it was okay to break them in half so i mostly did.  after about fifteen minutes i would get drowsy and then i would get a nice night's sleep.   this was incredibly valuable and it was no problem to go off the medication at the end of treatment because i was only taking it when i needed it anyway, only a couple times a week at the worst point.  the halitosis might have actually made it easier to stop taking--i had to really want the sleep and be willing to put up with the foul taste in my mouth. but if i needed the sleep badly enough it was really worth it."
1,"effective for falling and staying asleep slight dry mouth initially, but this subsided with use ( -  weeks) my problem was never falling asleep, it was waking up a few hours after falling asleep and being wide awake, my mind racing on thoughts of the day.  this medicine allowed me to fall asleep quickly and stay sleeping throughout the night.  my doctor told me it was originally marketed for anxiety/depression, but not widely prescribed for that once the sedative effects became known.  (i can't imagine taking one of these in the morning, as a anti-depressant....it would surely knock me out.)  the tablets are sold as  mg tablets.  i split mine ( mg) and for $ at target, i get two months worth.  highly recommend this for those who can't fall or stay asleep."
1,lamictal balanced moods without making me sluggish or slowing me down. i still have the highs and but they aren't drastically manically high. although it says it doesn't affect weight i did experience weight gain. it also makes me a little drowsy. i take  mg lamictal once per day at night so that i am not affected by the drowsiness. initially i started at mg and it was increased over time until i reached  mg in order to avoid side effects. it took time to experience the benefits. about  weeks.
1,"the benefits of using tretinoin were great. first of all i noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. but i had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. my skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter. luckily i did not notice any negative side effects. the positive effects that i noticed out weighed the negative ones. the side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. the burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. i believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more i used it. my treatment details are as follows: i used avita (tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. i waited about - minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. my doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. my doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. so every morning before leaving the house i made sure to apply a sunscreen."
0,"birth control, more mild and regular menstruation fatigue (severe during the first week of the month), nausea, mild depression appointment with doctor once every six months to monitor overall health, took pill once daily (usually in the morning after breakfast)."
1,"the benefits was getting off of drugs.  i go to a methadone clinic and i pay $ a day and i have for the last seven years.  it helped me get off of oxycotin's, but i would not recommend staying on it for long..  because methadone is more addictive than pain pills. passing out; falling asleep
drowsiness,
weight gain
when i first started i had alot of nausea, but after a few months it was better. when i first started going to the methadone clinic, i had to go there withdrawing.  i had to take a physical and a drug test when i started.  you can fail the first test, because they know you would have drugs in your system.  i had to pay $ when i first started and i pay almost $ a month, which equals out to be $. a day.

i get drug tested every month and i have passed so many that i get ""take homes"".  i only have to go there once a month now and i have to see my counslor for an hour each month and get drug tested.  i get called in for random drug testing.  i have to bring my bottles in so they will know that they are ""straight"" so they know i am not selling them.  they do that to everyone.  

i have been there for seven years now and i am  years old.  when i first started, i had to drive  / hours a day for seven days a week for three months and then i got one take home.

after three months of passing drug tests:   take home
 months:   take homes
one year:   take homes
 / years: a weeks worth
 years:  weeks worth
 / years:  a months worth....  i had to drive so much where there isn't many clinics in the states and i had to drive that far just to get to mine.

i have been doing good and being strong.  i just wish i would have lowered myself down after about  months.  so now i am addicted to methadone.  it is just legal and cheaper for me then pills and i know i get it everyday.

i hope i helped.

thanks.  :)"
0,"i ahve three sleep disorders: sleep apnea due to closing up of my throat (anatomical), restless leg syndrome and the worst one, hypersomnia -- tired much of the time with no explanation. i tried this drug - sent directly to the home and only with approved diagnosis (i am just short of narcolepsy) - to see if i would feel rested when i awoke. i did for one day but then the effects did not continue with each successive night. sounds strange, i know, but that is what happened. i did not have any side effects except that if i got less than  / hours of sleep after waking to take the second dose - i would stillfeel the effects -- as if drugged a bit. i think i have included everything above. i tried a second week and felt a slight refreshed feeling upon awakening - but not significant ewnough to keep taking it. understand, i only remember awakening refreshed  times in my life. one of them after that first night i used xyrem. i have enough to try a third week and probably will -- since i am desperate for my former qualilty of life when i didn't struggle with feeling tired as i do now."
1,"migraines diminished and appetite diminished, resulting in lost weight. initially began with  mg and increased in  mg increments until reaching  mg daily. difficulty in concentration, moodiness became the norm, stress. loss of weight which most likely caused the diagnosed potassium deficiency, which resulted in an irregular heat beat, resulting in stress symptoms, which resulted in stress test. very difficult first six months. switched doctors, my decision to stop medication. migraines returned. began taking topamax again, under different doctor, but at a dose of  mg daily.  worked. migraines greatly reduced, a slight difficulty initially with concentration and moodiness but then those symptoms improved. 

a year later at  mg daily i'm doing well. i can safely increase up to  mg when i know that known triggers are expected - low pressure weather system, menstrual cycle (haven't conquered that migraine yet!) etc."
1,"wellbutrin xl was the only anti-depressant i tried that i could take without noticable side effects. a big contributer to my depression was weight gain that accompanied it, and as a result my doctor prescribed wellbutrin because typically the patient either stays the same or loses weight will taking it, as opposed to almost every other anti-depressent which can cause weight gain. very minimal side effects. only noticable thing is that you can feel the pill wear off near bed time and that can cause a sudden spike in appetite. the wellbutrin helped me regain control of my appetite and as a result i took back control of my happiness and wellbeing."

0,"the drug did lower the blood cholesterol effectively. the side effects included nightmares, muscle weakness, dizziness. 
in addition there were emotional disturbances. the drug was prescribed by a cardiologist and was effective, however the side effects were considerable. after approximately one year the cholesterol ldl did drop and although this was positive, the side effects continued. after two years, the dosage was reduced to alternative days at the same daily dose. if the cholesterol level remains normal, with the adjustment of diet and exercise, the plan is to further reduce the drug over time."
0,"cleared upper respitory infection and strep throat yeast infection, hives, and overall skin sensitivity from clothing and certain foods, still unknown, trigger hives...simple things like wine, goldfish, lactaid milk, pancakes, eggs, bread, nuts, strawberries. the antibiotic significantly diminishes the immune system, allowing severe sensitivity to take over body and consumes productivity of your overall life. 

after four months, i still flare up from simple triggers and makes life pretty much stagnant."
1,also helped with hot flashes. it allowed for me to carry on with normal activities. mild jitters when first taking. if skipped would cause extreme heaviness and tiredness i took efexxor in the am and at lunch
1,acid reflux ceased to exist when taking prilosec. i have had no side effects from prilosec. it's pill you take  minutes before eating breakfast.  it stops the acid from the stomach backing up into the esopogus.
1,"depression has cleared up quite miraculously. eating too much - no sense of when to stop. slight antihistamine feel. i had been on celexa for two years, and noticed a major change in my libidio and concurrent diminishment of feeling in my sexual parts.  as i am married i started taking cialis to maintain an erection, and it worked fine, however, cialis didn't make me feel any more during lovemaking, and the whole topic increased my depression and worry. i didn't wish my wife to find out i took cialis because i love her dearly and didn't want her to think my sexual feelings were drug induced.  

i searched the internet for non-ssri antidepressants with little or no sexual side effects.  i talked to my psychiatrist about mirtazapine and he was fine with taperinf me off of the citalopram. within days of decreasing the citalopram i felt so much smarter. the mirtazapine has really allayed the depression and most of my anxiety.  i do also take buproprion and the two things do seem to allay depression and anxiety.

i definitely recommend trying mirtazapine if you're depressed, especially if you either hate ssris, or haven't founnd anything else which works. it doesn't really have such bad side effects. and my dreaming has become really interesting. i actually can't wait to go to bed now.  i did have a nightmare the first night i took it, but not since then. instead i have had all sorts of dream desire fulfillment, and it's odd how much that can make you feel more resourceful for the rest of your day.

i also wasn't able to work for the last two years because of moodiness and benzodiazpine use for anxiety and sleep.  now i have cut out all thosoe medications and i really do feel much better.  eating too much does seem to be an issue. i eat so much sometimes that i can't breate. that part is going to demand some serious self - control."
1,"it helped greatly with depression but had immediate sexual side effects. sexual side effects - loss of desire  also increased my restless leg syndrome. i was on the medication for about three months.  it helped enormously with the depression - i react well to ssri's - but as is typical for those meds, the side effects were too much for me and i switched to wellbutrin"

0,"takes about  months to show results, but cleared up my skin, reduced overall oiliness and enlarged pores, and eliminated my very greasy hair, caused by excess oil on my scalp. my skin looked hydrated, clarity was good and the improvement was constant with no variations after the first  months. also contributed a significant improvement to my libido. periods about every  days. after  months of use, dcis detected in my right breast. no history of breast cancer in the family at all, and i was in good health otherwise. malignant tumour of the breast was one of the side effects i located on the internet. i am happy to complete this but dont know what you mean, i have already given the dosage. can you email me what it is you want here?"
0,"due to extensive varicose veins, i was in pain, especially when standing. they were physically embarassing and i could not even wear sheer pantyhose. the surgery would eliminate pain and the ugliness.   i was told to take the drug before surgery to minimize swelling and to minimize pain. i do not like to introduce drugs into my body unless an emergency so i did not take it before the surgery, instead opting for bromelain enzyme, ginger and tumeric to reduce swelling. the side effects after the surgery were swelling and pain and possibly infection at the incision sites. about  hours post surgery, the pain became unbearable, and i decided to take one dose of acetaminophen w/codeine #.  when i got up a couple of hours later to go and use the bathroom, i passed out in the bathroom. lucky for me, my husband was nearby. i had a large vein stripped from my thigh and smaller ones in the leg, due to pain and discomfort i had been experiencing. it was an outpatient procedure that lasted about  hours."

0,"no positive benefits mood changes, weight gain ( pounds in  days!) extremely emotional. depression i had been using the trade brand of this patch, climara for several months with positive results.  one month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because i was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation, i agreed, thinking they had to be similar.  wrong!  to begin with, the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (i laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed, but soon it wasn't so funny.)  within a day or two i knew something was wrong, but hadn't yet identified the problem.  i couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  it seemed as if overnight, my world had become very sad and depressing. i immediately began to gain weight, despite no change in my dietary habits.  after finally putting two and two together, i ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  after rechecking my prescription, the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked ""no generics"".  apparently, he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  the pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal. i usually have no problem with genereic brands, but unfortunately, no more generic estradiol for me!"
0,taken only four days... not tested for benefits extreme pain in calf that soon extended to entire leg. muscles were rigid. i still suffer leg pain after more than a year off the four doses of zocor. just visited disneyword and did not realize till then how badly my legs hurt - day and night. one mg tab for four days upon advice of physician
1,"the benefits are that being on neurontin with the lidoderm patch %, it has helped to give me a much better quality of life.  my pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications, though not completely gone.  the side effects, to my knowledge, have been minimal, especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  could a different medication work better?  maybe. it's hard to say what the side effects might be.  i sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  however, i can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...). ten years ago i had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  fortunately it was benign.  the down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  the greatest nerve pain i have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  the skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  i have been very happy with neurotin for the most part.  i know it is working because if i am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  the neurotin alone does not work well.  in addition, i have to wear a lidoderm patch.  this has made a huge difference.  now, after nine years i'm beginning to feel my medication isn't working as well as it used to and am planning to review these changes with my doctor."
0,in saw immediate improvement in the clearing of my acne within the first week. yeast infection by day  despite eating yogurt and taking acidophilus along with doryx as suggested when i was prescribed the medication. the side effects definitely outweigh the benefits in this case. i am following up with the derm tomorrow to see if there is an alternative treatment because i can not go through these side effects again.
1,"it relaxed the spasm's in my back and neck, if not completely, at least  by - percent.  the best thing about this drug is that you can take it at work or during the day, and it does not make you drowsey or loopy. i experienced no side effects, other then the expected outcome, which was releif of the muscle spasam. i take this drug only as needed, when my back or neck feels tight or in spasam.  it is perfect for the weekend warrior, or someone who has occassional muscle soreness and tightness."

1,"since i tried to avoid the gi effect of motrin, or celebrex if used too long, the tramadol seemed a good alterntive.  i took it in the morning, and it generally seemed to energize me enough so that i stayed active, and if it didn't relieve the pain, it seemed to keep me from thinking about it and i remained busy. i did find that if i took it in the late afternoon, i really   couldn't sleep at night, mymind raed and i felt unsettled.   it reduced my appetite a bit, ad i would work without eating, or drinking.  had to remind myself to eat. i have degenerative joint desease in both my hands.  took the standrd painkillers, not narcotics, but asa, tylenol, motrin, and then celebrex.  the best was celebrex, but there is a danger with taking it long term.  ultram ws prescribed at first as mg twice a day.  this wasn't at all effective.  so we upped the dose, and this worked well, except not at night. since then i hae had boththumb joints replaced, and althoughi still have a prescription for the ultram, i rarely use it... sometimes for back aches.  someone once told me it is an opiate derivative.  if so, it does not seem to have an addictive quality, or any withdrawal symptoms, at least not the way i have used it."
0,"virtually nil. please< please read on.... if you take a look at the side effects the fda requires provigil manufacturer cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. however, failing to look at the side effects for provigil could end up costing you your life. provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. the side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the fda that it occurred to  out of every  test subjects while it happened to  out of every  who took the placebo. what is ""vasodilatation""?  vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  and, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for  out of every  users of provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

after  weeks on provigil, with the last week having been increased from mg to mg per day, i awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and i were seated. after apparently collapsing in my bedroom, i was taken to er, which quickly determined that i was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of /). i quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an er,  % to % die within hours or a few days. those who survive likely do so, as i did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy cpr session. my er doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center  miles away. as he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. the balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. arriving at the heart center i was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for  days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""i'm in"", the tv doctors always say when the get the insertion right)."
1,"helps me to sleep although does not help rls.  i sleep through the night now with requip to still my legs and trazodone to help me sleep.  it has made a huge difference.  i went through a sleep study prior to taking these meds and it turned out i was not getting any sustained deep sleep. at first i was terrible groggy, but i adjusted. i take it every night about / hour before i go to bed.  if i wait too late, i am tired in the morning but it is worth it!"
1,it drastically reduced breakouts all over my body therefore i did not constantly have flu like symptoms because of the breakouts. so even under stressful life events which usually results with a breakout the valtrax stopped or reduced the frequency of breakouts. so far i have only been taking  per day and i have not had any breakouts for a month. it initially made me feel tired and lethargic. i believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. i think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. since i am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem. i was supposed to take  tablets a day  in the morning and  in the evening. i followed this regimen for  and a half weeks then i decided to reduce the dosage myself to  per day. i checked with the nd and she said that protocol could be followed unless i felt that i was going to have a breakout then go back to  a day. i can take up to  per day if needed however so far the  per day has worked well for me.
0,"the first five days i felt amazing and i have had great sleeps for the  days. after the th day, i still slept well but my anxiety returned.  my balance has been off, i am extremely tired all day, there is a bad taste in my mouth which alters the taste of food. my mouth is so dry that i drink non-stop and cough a lot. what made me decide to quit this drug before the month trial is the fact that i have this really bad memory loss.  i forget where i live, my dog's name, my employees' names.  i would look at a steak and not remember what it was called.  i would stare blankly.  my job is detail oriented and i could not concentrate. i am supposed to take  mg a day.  i was told to take / in morning and / at bedtime or  mg at bedtime or  mg in the morning.  whatever works.  there are so many side effects that the good night sleep will have to be given up.  i can't stand a drug taking control of my body.  i hope there is a better treatment.  i have a call into my doctor."
1,"less fatigue, less weight unaccountable weight gain, less hair fall-out. none the only difficulty taking this is that one has to wait thirty minutes before eating or drinking in the morning.  therefore i take it upon first waking up - immediately.  or sometimes i take it and go back to bed if i am awake early."
0,"the synthroid medication did, for most of the ten years while i took it, keep my thyroid levels where they were supposed to be. after taking this synthroid medication for a period of about  years, here is what happened.  we were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden i began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak, with a rapid heart beat.  we were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  so i thought if i can just get to my home town and get to a hospital, they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  we arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room, where they ran several tests and i was there for several hours, but they could find nothing wrong with me.  so they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day, which i did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems. i was able to find an osteopathic doctor who put me on a natural thyroid, not a synthetic, he calld it a dessicated thyroid which came from an animal source, so i was able to get off the synthetic.  then after being on that for a while, he was able to get me off of that and i took a natural supplement, l- tyrosine 
it was wonderful to get off of a prescription medication.  i hope this information may be helpful to someone out there."
1,"within a few weeks of starting, my pressure was under control and has remained that way for over  years. i had no side effects that i noticed. i was diagnosed with high blood pressure (/) over  years ago, a few years after experiencing early menopause. severe headaches were also commmon. first treatment: dietary changes and increasing daily exercise--not adequate; in fact, it increased. i was prescribed cozaar,  mg/day, with the reminder that the first dosage tried was rarely the correct one. in my case, it was and i get checked now every  months. my blood pressure stays around / range."
1,"the benefits of using tretinoin were great. first of all i noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. but i had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. my skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter. luckily i did not notice any negative side effects. the positive effects that i noticed out weighed the negative ones. the side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. the burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. i believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more i used it. my treatment details are as follows: i used avita (tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. i waited about - minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. my doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. my doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. so every morning before leaving the house i made sure to apply a sunscreen."
0,my ability to focus improved and i was overall calmer. severe depression and thoughts of death. i found myself staring at the wall more than anything else. i felt totally drugged. my personality changed from somewhat lively to something very dull. it was as if the medication numbed my senses. i discontinued strattera after one month. i couldn't tolerate the depression anymore.
1,"i have found valium to be a godsend. it helps stave off migraine attacks, it helps me get to sleep when i have insomnia, and it relaxes  the muscles in my back when i get spasms. i use it sparingly, only when i really need it, (about - times a week ) and i have not found it to be addictive at all. i actually find it to be relatively mild, and i think it's over-regulated. i don't have any side effects from taking it. my migraine attacks are directly related to muscle spasms that occur in my lower intestine. my doctor called it an ""abdominal migraine."" if i take a valium when i feel a migraine coming on, it often goes away without having to take a maxalt. i've had a mastectomy, chemo & radiation, and have been through a lot of anxiety, but i don't rely on valium as an anti-anxiety drug. i'd be eating them like candy if i did, and then i probably would get addicted. i think valium should be considered more of a muscle relaxant. that's how i use it, anyway."
1,"it cleared up my coughing within  days.  i could sleep far better at night. i had mild diarrhea, though i'm not sure if it was due to the drug. i was told by my doctor to take the medication once a day for about  days.  the best results came within  days, and seemed to plateau after that.  i requested another prescription so i ended up taking it for about  weeks, but i seemed to see little improvement during the nd prescription.  it was probably because the bacteria was kept under control, but my body was taking time to heal."

0,"i had some experience with retin-a when i was a teenager in the mid 's.  my mom and i have the same type of skin - we both have some degree of acne as adults.  in the 's my mom started using retin-a to control this and apparently it worked well, so i tried it (her prescription) as a teenager and it just irritated my face , making it red and eventually flaky.  the drug is certainly powerful.  i am sure i would have benefited from continued use but i didn't.  now, approaching , i still have some acne and am starting to think any acne whatsoever is unacceptable.  reviewing options, retin-a seems top on the list.  i have read that retinol is a distant second.  however, i am hesitant because of the inevitable initial irritation and flakyness associated with retin-a. see above see above"

0,"depression lessened headaches after  years, no control over breathing, the drug created inner emotions and feeling that weren't present before starting taking the medication, the bi-treatment of lithium and risperidone also created feeling of excessive sleepiness, created a weight gain of more than my normal size, colors of objects turn more bland and life seems more pointless when taking risperidone during the day. taking the medication at bedtime turned out to be better. smoke  packs a day after taking the medication at night and waking up the next day. less able to control emotions. i had more energy than others when i was younger and the doctors and parents wanted to punish me for it by putting me on medication. havn't been able to get off them since because they are addicting and mind warping."

1,"the treatment benefits of taking predisone for asthama were that it reduced the inflammation and eased breathing.  although steroids are being scrutinized in the media at this time, they do have a place in the treatment of life threatening episodes of asthma and other diseases that casue severe inflammation.  i do not care to be on prednisone for any period of time, however, breathing is necessary to life and the prednisone offers a quick relief of the symptoms. while taking the prednisone i had an increase in blood pressure.  i also was very perspired while the dose was higher and felt extremely edgy and agitated. the prednisone was prescribed for a rebound effect after an anaphylactic reaction.  while at the er i was given solumedrol and benadryl.  since i have asthma, a prednisone taper was prescribed in the event that a rebound effect occured, which it did.  i began the taper immediately upon the worsening of symptoms.  it took about  hours for the prednisone to begin working.  during that time, there was a back and forth response from my body as it fought the prednisone for control.  during this event, i learned that i will always use my epipen in the future as adrenalin is not always part of the protocol at the er.  the adrenalin stops the initial reaction and may prevent the need for the prednisone later."

1,"my son had a definite and rather dramatic increase in his ability to focus at school, complete his homework and we even saw a difference in his sports performance.  he went from grades averaging c's, with some lower, to a & b's for most classes within just a couple of months.  even his teachers were very impressed with the difference, and my son's confidence improved tremendously. the side effects have been very mild. at some points he seems more argumentative and high strung, but not most of the time.  generally this medication has been well tolerated.  we do not administer the medication on the weekends or when he is not at school (during school breaks or during the summer). the treatment with concerta is simple - he takes  one pill a day during the school week.  we have semi-annual visits with the dr. to check on his progress.  while starting the medication, we had to adjust the dosage slowly upward.  but he had maintained the current dose for more than . years now with good affects."
1,"this drug helped me to be able to fall sleep during an extremely stressful period in my life when i simply could not fall asleep.  i had tried many herbal sleep remedies, homeopathics, melatonin supplements, acupuncture and so forth, but the serax was the only thing that helped me.  initially during treatment i would be able to sleep - hours which was a huge benefit to me as i was exhausted from insomnia and stress. sometimes i would feel a slight tension in my head the next morning, but this was better than total exhaustion from sleeplessness.  more recently i find that on the rare occasions that i use serax, i wake up with a headache if i take a full capsule.  i find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache. my doctor tried various antidepressant type sleep medications to help me to sleep but they did not help at all.  they left me feeling groggy and with a strange disconnected feeling.   we also tried ambien but this only helped me get about  hours of sleep and then i'd wake up and feel strange.  the serax worked for me to help me fall asleep when i couldn't sleep, and to stay asleep for - hours.  also there were hardly any side effects except for the slight headache.  i had no trouble going off the medication during the times when i no longer needed it.  sometimes i would taper from  capsule to / capsule per night, or one night on and one night off the medication, but most times i simply stopped using it when i no longer needed it.   i still use a half a capsule occasionally when i travel if i have trouble falling asleep."

1,"the benefits of taking zomig are suppression of migraine/headache pain for at least - hours.  sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack. the side effects of taking zomig for me are inability to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake. i can take zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  the sooner i  take it the faster it works.  if i take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but i have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  if i take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  it also makes me feel very foggy and i cannot drive. sometimes i have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  sometimes if i catch the headache early enough and go to bed i can cut the dose in half and it still works.  it's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. if i wait too long to take it, nausea sets in and i cannot keep the medication down.  then i need to take the sublingual dose, which i don't like to purchase because i can't divide the doses at all.  
i am very happy to have a medicine that alleviates the extreme migraine pain but i wish it didn't make me so drowsy because that still cuts into my productivity."

1,"the best , best thing about wellbutrin is that i have my sex drive back fully and i am realizing how much i missed it. that has been fantastic. i have noticed some appetite suppression too, which seems to sort of come and go, but it's definitely a welcome side effect. i have been able to get a lot done at work, which is never a bad thing, but it's also unpredictable thus far. i also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness i would experience if i missed a dose of zoloft. i'm still sorting out the side effects. i keep having waves of anxiety and depression interspersed with days of feeling great. i have noticed i'm more quick to anger, which isn't really all that bad. makes me realize i'm feeling things fully. i have had some difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite, sometimes good, sometimes a little alarming. i decided that i wanted to go off zoloft because, while on it, i still experienced some depressive episodes and a terrible loss of libido. i felt out of control and wanted to reclaim that part of myself so i tapered slowly off of zoloft... which was very difficult, as it can make one very very sick, with flu-like symptoms. while tapering off i began taking the  mg dose of wellbutrin. i still don't feel % treated, if one ever can, but i am happy to have myself back, even if i'm not always as good as i want to be!"

1,"the depression was treated effectively. i felt more normal shortly after starting treatment. i apparently didn't have any side effects, at least not any listed on the drug information. however, after a period of a couple months, i became completely turned off by sex. after a longer period, i got freaked out by the idea, not good for a married woman. still i didn't associate it with zoloft. i spoke with a friend who had taken zoloft as well, and she stated that she was 'running' from her husband regarding sex and changed meds. i also requested a change to another anti-depressant and no longer have a libido problem. i was suffering from clinical depression that manifested itself as overall crankiness, irritability and sore, aching muscles in my shoulders and neck. my doctor prescribed muscle relaxers and x-rayed my neck. no problems. i went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed depression. i was given zoloft and the irritability and muscle aches went away very quickly."
0,"i had to stop the medicine because of the side effects and he got sicker (i know you aren't supposed to stop antibiotics for this exact reason).  he ended up on another antibiotic that worked well. he's one year old, and his mood changed drastically.  he became agressive and mean.  clenching his fists, growling, hitting his sister and pulling her hair and being totally uncooperative were our everyday behaviors.  he is normally a laid back, sweet child.  the pediatrition disagrees and says it wasn't the medicine, but i know it was. he was supposed to take it for  days, but the behavior was out of control, so the pediatrition told me to stop it for  hours and see if the behavior changed.  i stopped on day  and within  hours, he started to improve- within  hours he was almost back to normal.  the pediatrition and pharmacist both say that it doesn't go to the brain, and therefore can't cause behavior changes, but something in that drug definitely effected him.  i know my child and i watched him very carefully, i know it was the antibiotic.  i won't be using it again for either of my children."
0,"made dental implants possible the triazolam seemed to stay in my system for days. i experienced a moderate degree of memory loss. there were also a couple instances of loss of cognitive reasoning, which was most frightening. i had total dental implants, which involved removing my existing deteriorating teeth (full set) and then placing first, temporary titanium posts into my upper and lower jaws and then permanent posts. a series of temporary acrylic ""teeth"" were fashioned to fit onto the temporary and permanent posts until my gums healed. then permanent porcelain teeth were attached to the implant posts."
1,"it gave me back my life. since taking this my brain chemicals are balanced. several times i have tapered down and twice, off, and the effects have been terrible. for me, i have a depression that cycles me into such a deep dark place that it is terrifying. i was suicidal and had great despair. the only thing that changed was taking this medication. i know it does't work for everyone but for me, it waas and continues to be a lifesaver. i am very very thankful everyday. it takes a few weeks for your brain to become right. i would have a flash of vertigo now and then, but that's it. nothing else.my body is obviously not able to make the amount of seritonin required. it is genetic. i began on the tiniest amount,  mg. once a day. it was not at all effective. i was upped to  mg. daily and that made a difference. afer about  months, at my request, the dosage was upped to mg. daily. this held me for  years. then i crashed again. the doctor upped it to  mg., taking mg in the morning and mg at bedtime. this has worked for me for many years. 
once you pull out of a depression, which is a very physical thing for me, and you can experience a life that is not defined by how gray to black it is, it is humbling. i can now experience tasting food, having a sex life, feeling joy, and actually bound out of bed. my energy is normal. 
anyone who claims that they pop antidepressants for kicks as if they were uppers or downers has got to be making it up. if you have ever experienced true clinical level depression and then had the gift of taking this medication and for the first time really having a life like everybody else,  you would never ever abuse it. it is so precious to feel normal for the first time. i will take this medication for the rest of my life.
this must be how it is for people who take insulin. it's about getting your personal body chemistry righted."
0,"my migraine intensed but then subsided within  hours of taking this medication. when you receive this medication it comes with a patient information pamphlet giving each side effect for the drug and i experienced every side effect there was. at first i experienced heat flushes, then slight muscle spasms,  minutes into this drug's effect i experienced a tightness in my neck. this scared me because i thought i was having an intense allergic reaction to the drug. then, there was a lot of pressure in my head so i then took an aleve and that pretty much eased everything out. i will never take this medication again. was given once for a migraine treatment option."
1,"urinary frequency and urgency have been substantially reduced; i have a vastly improved lifestyle because these problems no longer inhibit my activities. i experienced mild constipation in the beginning but because i eat a vegetarian diet i have been able to manage this side effect easily by increasing dietary fiber.  no other measures have been necessary. my gynecologist changed me to vesicare when i complained about side effects from the previous rx i was on for overactive bladder.  (these were dry mouth and constipation.)  after beginning to take vesicare daily, i noticed an immediate improvement, i.e., sharp decrease in the negative side effects.  i plan to continue the use of vesicare because there seem to be no prohibitions to its long term use.  it may also possibly postpone surgical repair of the pelvic prolapse."

0,"there were some good benefits, such as it would relax me and was able to get a good nights sleep.i felt more confident when taking this drug as it dulls your senses and changes everything into a positive.after a couple of months i became dependant on xanax as it made me feel good about myself. there are many side effects that i experienced at different times.the worst side effect was that i would go into a rage and yell at my partner for the littlest things.even though i was aware how bad i was,the anger inside of me took over and there wasn't any control.the morning dose always made me tired for the rest of the day, so i only took half a tablet to be able to function during the day.it is also a depressant which did not help me and is so addictive that you actually fret about getting your next prescription. xanax is used to treat a number of illnesses such as bipolar, panic disorder and insomnia.it is effective but also has some serious side effects and in the end you have to outweigh the good against the bad. normal dosage for biploar and panic disorder is  mg twice daily, which is a very strong dose.in the first few months that you take it be aware that it makes you extremely tired and on several occasions i have fallen asleep in public places!"

initially, it was working well, then i developed weight gain and terrible edema in my ankles and legs. sometimes it didn't make me sleepy and i doubled my dose. it literally made me green with nausea, but i was able to sleep. lighter doses didn't work. my doctor gradually upped my dose until it was high enough to be effective. after  years, i decided to quit taking the medicine cold turkey. this was five months ago because of the low libido. i was a basket case, but it was out of my system in about four days. i later found out that you should go off it gradually with a doctor's supervision. quitting, as i did, could cause you to be suicidal. it certainly was very difficult on me. 

during my time drug free, i developed anger issues, depression and wanted to hurt myself. my sleep became light again, causing muscle pain from lack of rest.

after several months drug free, i restarted the medication for insomnia. immediately my ankles and legs swelled greatly with edema. the water retention and edema is still there even after several days of discontinuing the medication. maybe this is because i took a high dosage. i plan to go back to my doctor and try something different."

1,"the benefits were none.  however, it did not cause me any difficulties or side effects.  i approved of the idea of taking the medication to reduce my general low level anxiety as an additional treatment to lowering my high blood pressure. but i experienced no improvements at this dose. the idea was to help with anxiety as an aid to lower my blood pressure.  however, neither my blood pressure, with another medication, or the level of anxiety was reduced.  the lorazepam was stopped after a week when i complained of ineffectiveness. i did not experience any side effects with this medication. i was to take this medication once a day in the morning.  when i felt no benefit i discussed it with the doctor who suggested an increase of the dosage.  i declined.  the treatment theory was that the lorazepam would help me with anxiety and stress which in turn would be an aid in addition with the blood pressure medication to lower my blood pressure."
1,"the drug helped elminate most of the discharge and healed my yeast infection mostly. i was feeling a bit tired and drowsy. after taking the drug for  weeks most of the infection had cleared up.

1,"my son suffered from headaches that would really affect his daily activities. he was prescribed the nasonex to control his allergies and reduce his sinus symptoms that may have been contributing to his headaches. after about  weeks of daily use of the nasonex, his headaches were occurring siginificantly less often and he felt much relief. he was able to reduce his use of ibuprofen which i was really glad for because i worried that he may have rebound headaches from over-use of ibuprofen. i also worried that he may develop an ulcer from using the nsaid's so frequently. he was also able to get a better nights sleep. that improved his performance at school and his general energy level. previously he was always tired during the day, after he started taking the nasonex continuously, as directed, he felt more energetic, and had many less headaches, too. at first, the nasal spray was a little irritating to the nose, and he would sneeze after the administration. he just didn't like the spray into his nose. he stuck with it and after about  days, it didn't bother him anymore. other than that, we have not noticed any negative side effects of the medication. he takes the nasal spray in the morning and at night- sprays each. it controls his allergies and he no longer suffers from the sinus headaches that were interfering with his life on a daily basis."

0,exfoliates the skin. it is said to prevent or treat acne and acne scars. whether this is true is questionable. the drug induced some dryness and flakiness especially around the nose area and chin area. this side effect can go away after a while the product is a gel that is put on every night. it supposedly prevents new  blemishes and promotes exfoliation. the results for the blemishes were not satisfactory.

1,"i have had problems falling asleep for many years. i had tried various other medicines, both over the counter and prescription, and nothing seemed to work - some didn't work at all, some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night, and others made me tired and feeling as if i were drugged the next morning. then one day, my dentist prescribed one ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction, and i actually fell asleep standing up! this is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep, sleep through the night, and doesn't make me feel tired the next day. plus, it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry, anxiety, and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before. one of the warnings on the bottle is ""may cause drowsiness"". well, that's why i am taking it! if you don't want to feel drowsy, then ativan is probably not for you. another drawback is that if it is used too often, your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. when i first began taking ativan, i only needed half a mg. to fall asleep, so i would cut a tablet in half. i only use it  or  times a month, but even at that dosage, after having used it for several years, i now find i have to take a whole tablet in order for the ativan to help me sleep. after having this prescribed to me by my dentist, i knew it was very effective. i'd tried various other medications prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep, so i told him i'd like to try ativans as they had worked so well as a relaxant before a dental extraction. we worked together to come up with a dosage, and he then prescribed the mg. as stated before, the one mg. was more than enough at first, so i would cut the tablets in half and for the first couple years this worked just fine. for the past couple years though, i've had to use the mg. before bedtime... and will probably have to talk with my doctor soon about going to a stronger dosage as i am noticing lately that it is not working as well as it once did."

1,"greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily.  this drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so dibilitating that i could not function in everyday life, i.e., go to work, take care of self and family, etc.  migraines were reduced after approximately - weeks on the medication to about  per month and then continually reduced to  every  to  months as i stayed on the medication.  i also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood stabalizer, because this drug also manages to keep me from getting ""manic"", so it is an extra ""bonus"" on top of the migraine management!! the only side effect i noticed was some weight loss in the beginning.  my doctor was very careful to start me out on  mg and move me up very slowly to the  mg x per day, which i understand is a very high dosage and took all of  years to get to that dosage.  i was monitored every  days to ensure that i was not losing too much weight, having any type of eye problems, or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems, and numbness i never experienced; but was always told that if i did experience even a hint of these things, that i would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  i have also read that topamax has been used to treat alcoholics, and have noticed that since taking it, i have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but i am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  it really just seems like a great drug!! i am still taking it to manage both  my migraines and my mood disorder-- mg x per day.  i take  in the am and  in the pm.  it is prescribed by my neurologist and managed by him mostly; and my psychatrist also works with him, because if i ever go off of the drug, i would be required to go onto a mood stabalizer due to the bi-polar disorder.  i would be very unhappy to have to go back onto something like depakote, because that made me very slow and sluggish and topamax does not have that side effect."

1,"within a week, i felt as if dark cloud of loneliness and unbearable sadness had drifted away. i had some gi issues, some bloating and intestinal gas, but this went away after a few weeks. initially i was a participant in a blind study, which lasted about six weeks.  i suspected that i was not in the control group because of my dramatic results.  following the study, we were each given a consultation with the physician who was overseeing the test.  he was the head of the psychopharmacology department at the university of pennsylvania.  he explained to me how the drug worked and suggested that i stay on it for a while.  i remember he remarked how i walked the first few days of the test, and how different my demeanor became after the first week.  i stayed on the drug for close to two years, then weaned myself off."

1,"i have chronic allergies because i am allergic to dust rather than a seasonal allergen, like ragweed. i have tried many products, but typically they are so drying that i am forced to discontinue use. this product is effective at reducing the production of mucus and eye irritation from a sever allergy to dust. i haven;t used this generally, i find allergy medications, such as claritin and zyrtec to be too drying to be useful. i live in a dry city (los angeles) and i am prone to nose bleeds, dry eyes and dry skin. there is still some drying associated with this drug if i take it daily. however, if i take it occasionally, it is fine. i also can tolerate prolonged usage of this medication better than  i can other allergy medications. the prescription says to take  tablet every day as needed for allergies. my allergist suggested i use this daily, as i have chronically dark circles under my eyes and a drippy nose, even though i have a home with zero carpet and have sealed my bed and pillows in allergen barriers. however, i do not take this daily because it is drying and costly to do so. i use this occasionally when i sleep at someone';s house or need to dust or sweep."

1,"after menopause, i experienced painful intercourse and some bleeding caused by vaginal dryness. i tried over-the-counter lubricants including suppositories but found them to be inconsistent and they also masked sensitivity in the vaginity area. vagifem has little side effects. i occasionally notice some discharge. i also feel bloated for a day or so after inserting. the small tablet is inserted vaginally twice a week. it's recommended that you do so at the same time of day. twice a week is somewhat difficult to keep track of. does that mean every  days or every  days? it involves marking treatment down on a calendar to maintain a regular schedule."
1,"the treatment benefits of taking synthroid have everything to do with metabolism regulation.  because i had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed, it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own. there have been no treatment side effects for me thus far. treatment consists simply of taking a  mcg synthroid pill each morning.  this should be taken on an empty stomach and no food should be taken for one full hour.  it is also important not to take any calcium supplement for four hours after taking synthroid.  calcium interferes with the body's ability to effectively utilize the synthroid."

1,"the treatment eased pain very efficiently. i had no pain all day after just  pills. besides, i did not feel numb or anything, only the pain went away. none obvious that i could feel, at least in the short term. not sure about long term side effects. but i'm not taking this drug for too long or dependent on it so guess it won't be a problem. i had a toothache and went to the doctor who prescribed this drug to me. it was very effective and no side effect, at least not on me. after a day, my toothache went away."

1,"it would ease the throbbing feeling associated with a migraine. low blood pressure. you could feel a marked difference in your blood pressure, that was the only negative side effect. other than that, it helped calm the pulsating sensation you would get with an intense migraine. helping you to relax and feel better."
0,cant say because i had to stop taking it after just  days due to severe after effects excrutiaing stomach/intestinal pain the drug was prescribed for treating h-pylori infection but it caused ore severe pain than hte ailment itself. it was too strong a drug for me and i had to be switced erothromycin and amoxcillin after only  days of tetracycline combo. it also made me dizzy.

0,"the drug helped with sleep, but was inconsistent. i was a chronic insomniac, rarely sleeping more than  hours a night, often less.  with amitriptyline i was able to sleep more regularly (although not always), thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole. unfortunately, athough i was sleeping more regularly, i was still not rejuvenated.  the sleep was of a drugged quality, remarkably different from a natural sleep, in that i still felt tired a lot of the time.  always dry mouth after the night, and after several years of use, i wondered if it had affected my memory, as loss of memory was notable. seems to me that i had frequent headaches, as well. i took the drug every night, just before i intended to sleep.  often i would fall asleep, but still wake in the night, although usually falling asleep again, which i would not be able to do without the drug.  mornings were a little foggy for me, and there was the reality of dry-mouth, and the possibility of a headache.  i tried to quit for several months after the second year, but was so plagued by insomnia that i went back on it.  after another  months or so, i quit because i was worried that the long term use had affected my memory and the efficacy of the drug was inconsistent in any case."

1,"i have seasonal allergies and especially in the spring and fall, my eyes itch and get dry. these drops contain anti-histamines that are delivered directly into the eye, and therefore are more effective than just using anti-histamine pills. i think they also helped with the eczema-like flaking on my eyelids but i cannot be sure because i was also using anti-histamine pills at the time. i did not experience any side effects. these drops really helped with the symptoms but i did wish i could use it more often than just  times a day."

.mg remeron  hour before bed.
lexapro is way too stimulating. i cant imagine it making me groggy really, it feels almost like cathinone stimulation. on the verge of euphoric, but not, and very jittery - so i was hoping the remeron would counteract that like the doc said. another day on the weekend this time(blue and green keyboard made it really hard to work in the morning) ill attempt to start again, hopefully that was a strange occurrence(although, it was entertaining, but not ok for going to work!)."

0,"none drug-induced psychosis, resulting in  day commitment to a mental institution. many people i know - i now work as a health care professional - erroneously believe that valium, xanax, ativan, and other benzodiazepines must be used ""as directed"" and have enhanced benefit if ""built up in the brain""- ie: in ways similar to ssri's effect on the brain over time.  i was entirely aware that diazepam is a ""prn"" medication, and chose to use the prescribed dosage on one particular day hoping it would carry me through a difficult situation. unfortunately, i suffered a ""paradoxical reaction"" which cost me dearly in many tragic ways.  i was in a state of severe psychosis for days- because my ""benzo"" level was low when admitted to the hospital, i was given diazepam for an additional two days, whereupon i apparently refused to take any medication at all, and recovered as i ""detoxed"".  i have absolutely no memory of five days of my life.  i have done research into this phenomenon, and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/gaba reuptake variants- such as those with adhd, parkinsons, and also ptsd.  diazepam is a ""bandaid"" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  in fact, ""rebound"" anxiety and profound depression are common. what is most ironic is that in the medical setting, this occurs often after administration of ""versed"", is recognized quickly, and fluzanimine is given as an antidote. outside of this scenario, the patient is blamed, treated as a suspected drug addict, and stigmatized."

1,"the vermox killed off the effects of the parasitic illness which included extreme fatigue, chronic diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss.  the celexa was effective in elevating my mood which had been diagnosed as depression.  it was the doctor�s belief that the long term effects of the parasite presence in my body led to my decline in physical and mental health.  i continued on the generic form of celexa, citalopram for a total of three years.  i no longer take medication for depression and my health is quite good. the side effect of the vermox was primarily a metallic taste in my mouth which lasted throughout the treatment of twenty one days.  the celexa  gave me a symptoms of dry mouth as well as some decrease in sexual desire. i took a vermox tablet orally for three weeks and another dose for three days a month later.  i began taking a dosage of celexa of mg which was eventually reduced to mg per day after about  � years.  i continued a dosage of mg for another  � years, but switched to the generic form, citalopram."

1,"prior to taking the amoxicillin i was in a lot of discomfort including tightness in the chest, fever, painful cough and difficulty in breathing. this meant that i was not able to work and had to stay in bed. the effects of the amoxicillin was almost immediate in that within two hours of taking the drug many of they symptoms had diminished considerably; in particular, breathing was no longer difficult or painful and the fever was reduced. due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of amoxicillin i was able to return to work almost immediately. there were no noticable side effects.  for the seven day period that i was taking the amoxicillin caplets i did not feel 'normal' in that i felt light headed and somewhat disconnected.  however, i was still coughing with the chest infection and it was difficult to tell how much of what i was feeling was due to the infection and its after-effects and how much was due to the amoxicillin.  my own perception was that the amoxicillin had no noticable side-effects. i was prescribed  amoxicillin caplets which were mg per dose.  i was instructed to take the medicine at regularly spaced intervals and to complete the prescribed course.  i therefore took one caplet at breakfast at around am, one caplet after lunch at around pm and one caplet in the evening at around pm.  i was not advised to take the amoxicillin caplets with food and, apart from the first daily dose, the times i took the caplets did not coincide with meals. i swallowed the caplets with water as advised."
1,"incidents reduced from daily to maybe every  to  weeks.  if i missed my dose however by hour  i would start to break out.  this would indicate to me that the histamine levels are ever present and the histamine blocker is what is keeping their ill effects at bay.  i have however discovered that recently my pharmacy changed their generic manufacturer and the new version is very ineffective.  i've had + severe breakouts in  months virtually none.  not drowsiness, not upset stomach, no nothing.  just don't miss your dose. take one at  am when i wake up, the other at pm after supper."

0,"the treatment benefits included feeling less anxiety, stress and pressure in many social situations. i felt less irritable and more willing and open for change. i had been feeling very down on myself and �lost� in terms of my emotional well being and stability. i had been feeling a lot of pressure and like i didn�t fit in in many situations. i also felt that many things in life were hard- even small things like showering or brushing my teeth. taking this medication helped me to overcome those feelings and be able to do everyday things without seeing them as such a challenge. it stabilized my mood as well so i wasn�t experiencing major irritability, intense frustration or anger. the side effects i experienced from this drug were minimal. i did experience some headaches and a bit of a �spacey� feeling in the head when i first started taking it. overall, i would say that the major issue i experienced which i am considering a side effect was a dulling of the emotions. while it helped me to curb my frustration and irritability, it also dulled my ability to feel great happiness or excitement about anything. my husband complained that i just stopped caring about everything. i also became completely disinterested in sex. i am unsure of what the treatment details mean. i took this drug for about a year under the supervision of my general practioner. i took a  mg dosage the entire time. this dose was never increased. the drug took about  weeks before i noticed the benefits. i stopped taking the drug when i, along with my gp felt that i was doing better and no longer needed it."
0,"reduced acne and refined skin texture. helped to prevent new breakouts to a certain extent. dry skin. after washing even with the mildest cleansers i noticed my skin would be very tight and uncomforable. differin is a retinoid, supposedly the mildest of all retinoids. i was prescribed this for mild, yet persistent acne. while it did help clear up the acne it also caused me to continue to get more pimples in areas i didnt normally get them. so it was a slight paradox. 

i would have continued to use the medication of it wasnt for the dryness and tighness i used to get after water touched my skin. my skin never felt comfortable. i gave it a good  months but my skin never seemed to adjust.

so while it worked pretty good for the acne, it also caused to much skin dryness. so i moved onto a new treatment method."
1,"for the treatment of insomnia, this drug induced sleepiness immediately after ingestion which was a tempory and necessary goal of the drug. minimal side effects included mild grogginess upon waking. although this medication was immediately effective in treating insomnia, it was also temporary. more dosage was required after a few weeks, and addiction was possible. off the medication, insomnia returned and was more severe than prior to taking this drug."
0,"i had been having abdominal pain for quites some time which was diagnosed as h-pylorybacter.  i started taking the biaxin as pary of prevpac.  in about  days, i noticed that the pain was lessening and i was feeling less run down. i had been ill due to the condition being undiagnosed for about  months. the infection was clearing up after  taking the biaxin for  days and feeling much improvement, i started noticing some itchy bumps on my legs.  over the next  days, my whole body erupted into welts, especially in the axilla, the groin. i called my doctoe and stopped the biaxin. i continued to have new hives each day for the next  days.  gradually they went away. to eliminate the side effects of hives, i had to stop the biaxin and all other medication.  i ties taking sudaphed to control the itching, but this was not effective.  i ended up going to the emergency room because the welst were so itchy and painful and i had not slept in  days.  they were unable to give me any medication for the reaction beacuse of my gastrointestinal distress.  i had to jus wait it out."
1,"pain and heartburn from extreme acid reflux is well controlled, hypersensitivity to certain food is suppressed and barrett's esophagus has not progressed. none that i am aware of. i take nexium once a day in the morning. if i have a flare up of acid reflux, i will take another at dinner time. the once a day regime generally controls my acid reflux quite well. on the rare occasions when i forget to take nexium, reflux flares up immediately, so i have good evidence it is responsible for the symptom control."
1,"reduced the acid reflux and heartburn that was present in the late evening hours. overall, nexium relieved me of acid reflux and heartburn. i did not experience side effects, although some people do. i took a pill everyday (with water) about a hour before my dinner. i did not skip any days, but used everyday, so as to prevent heartburn rather than treat it."
1,"provigil energizes me which improves my ability to function. without it, the fatigue i experience due to ms overwhelms me and renders me pretty much useless. the only side effect is increased wakefulness at night when i'd like to go to  sleep. the neurologist who first diagnosed the ms prescribed provigil in . at first i took only  milligrams per day, but have gradually increased the dose in order to get the same effect i got initially. i've asked my doctors several times if the drug is addictive, and they say it is not supposed to be."
1,requip has helped me sleep at night! no more horrible creepy crawley sensations... great medication! none. take  pill  hours before bedtime.
1,i could see a dramatic difference in my mood within  weeks!  i felt interested in all my hobbies again plus i was smiling and laughing more.  my doctor told me i could be the poster child for paxil.  this drug made a remarkable improvement in my mild depressive state.  i recently ( wks ago) underwent gastric bypass surgery.  the doctor that performed this surgery told me not to quit taking paxil...it would be like losing my best friend.  i have had absolutely no depression after my surgery (which i understand is not common).  this drug is amazing! the only side effects i had were temporary decreased sexual desire and a decreased ability to have orgasms.  these side effects went away after about  months on this drug. i take one  mg. pill once a day at the same time.  i usually take my pill first thing in the morning because it's easier for me to remember.  i did research on this product before i actually started taking it and found that the  mg. dose had the same results as the  mg. dose and showed no marked improvement.  the  mg. dose has been great for me.
1,"smoother skin with no pimples present. lessening of fine lines. more even and radiant skin tone slight peeling and redness when treatment began i began taking retin-a because my skin was having breakouts at a very frequent rate. i began by washing my face with a mild ceanser. i alternated between dove senstive skin and cetaphil. the face must be washed gently with no manipulation, scrubbing or washcloth!! after this i rinse with warm water to make sure all soap residue is gone. i then lightly pat my face dry with the softest towel i can find. let the face air dry for  minutes, then a pea size amount of retin-a can be applied to the face. this little amount is for the whole face. once the whole face is covered with the retin-a , let it sink in for  minutes, then apply a moisturizer. i like to use cetaphil cream for this or moisturel. remember that retin-a should only be used at night!! you must wear an spf  sunscreen during the day as it makes the skin sensitive."
1,"increased my estrogen levels, started ovulating again, and after about  months my ovulation formed a predictable pattern with an ending menstrual period. it was an easy small sized capsule to swallow and did not break down in water. once ovulation was kicked off and preganancy still did not occur, it allowed my obstetrician to focus on other possible problems. initially there were no problems, but after a week or so, began to suffer from blurred vision, which would appear and disappear at random. hot flushes would also be sporadic. i also had a sense of ""scatterbrain"" ie my mind felt jumbled up, i could not make quick decisions, everything seemed blurry in my head. my stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  on some days i vomitted.over time this decreased, and eventually after  and / years these symptons stopped. the time line probably could be reduced, but on ocassions of sickness, i stopped taking clomid and began the next month. my skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. i had a very heightened sense of smell as well. after a first successful pregnancy, my attempts at a second were not succeeding. medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. this coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. a dosage of clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels, produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness, vomitting, unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity, which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones, the side effects stopped. whilst not inducing a pregancy, it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. overall, clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. i would recommend its use."
0,"i got much better in a few days. started having hallucinations. began to see dead people (mother, father,siblings) after a few days, couldn't move. just sat in one place staring. a neighbor finally took me to the hospital. afterward, the doctor told me that i had had both a heart attack and a stroke as a result of the medicine. by day  on the pills i was losing touch with reality. by day  i was hospitalized in intensive care."
1,"this medication was initially prescribed for pain management and was somewhat effective, but a new neurologist suggested incresing the dose as an addition to the anti-seizure medications that were not completely controlling my epilesy.  this addition finally got the seizures completely under control. sometimes i feel a bit nauseated if i take it with my other medications. as i stated, increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.  i was originally prescribed this drug for pain management of a chronic pain problem, but in a lower dose. while i feel that is has only had a minimal effect of lmy pain, the higher dose has gotten my seizures under control.  i also suffer from depression and a panic disorder that may be helped from this drug, but i think that that may be true indirectly, as i think the elimination of the seizures has been the main cause of the relief, particularly the anxiety."
0,"not very many at all. my blood pressure is still high sometimes. doctor advice me not to increase dosis.but i am scared to stop the medication by myself and have serious health problems. horrible headaches,sensation of fullness in my head,dizziness, nausea, extreme fatigue, permanent ear ringing sensation,insomnia.i feel cold most all the time even if it is warm in the room i am in or outdoors. i want to clarify that except for the hbp i have never had these symptoms prior to taking the medicine."
1,"regularly reduced fasting blood glucose by - points initial diarrhea. must gradually titrate up to the assigned dose, and take with food. i would take one  mg pill every time i ate, or   mg pills at breakfast/dinner. effects were apparent after  days. i am still on this medication, as i no longer have side effects."

0,"reduction in white heads however i think i still need longer treatment to get rid of blackheads, i am hoping it will also help to slow down aging process. i must be carefull not to get pregnant as it might cause problems . i believe it is contraindicated in pregnancy. i am also using hydroxyquinolone for melasma. it started to provide results during nd month of treatment. none. although they do say it can cause dryeness, however my skin is quite oily so i am not worried.i must be carefull not to get pregnant as it might cause problems . i believe it is contraindicated in pregnancy.it was very easy to use.i used powder and moisturiser over it with no problem. used - times a week depnding on occurance of white heads. dermatologist recommended to use it three times a week.iam still waitin gto see whether blackheads will go. i must use sunscreen if used during day. this is certaintly the best cream i have ever used for this problem. at the same time i will try not to use it for a long time as it can cause side effects."
1,the urinary tract infection which causing frequent urination and a lot of discomfort was completely cleared up after i took this drug.  this drug has been effective for me on more than one occasion. i did not have any side effects that i am aware of. i took two tablets of bactrim x per day with a glass of water.  i was careful to drink plenty of water throughout the day.

1,"helps me to concentrate and focus for a more prolonged period of time than adderall xr mg. when taking adderall xr mg, i had a lot of side effects ranging from dry mouth to aggressive behavior. i was very irritable with adderall xr, but with vyvanse i am not irritable at all as a symptom of the drug. i focus and concentrate much better, and for much longer, i have no symptoms. i feel more calm and more happy on vyvanse. the only negative side effect was the insomnia for the first few weeks, but that is to be expected from this type of drug i believe. vyvanse mg taken once daily in the morning."
1,"when i took the medication as prescribed, if i were to smoke, i would feel sick to my stomach, it surpressed the thoughts of smoking, and the cravings.  as i have read, its not so much the nicotine, since i can sleep for  hours without craving nicotine, its the little voice in my head that tells me its time for my bad habit.  it also surpressed any craving for alcohol. vivid dreams, and the loss of my intuitiveness. one pill twice daily with alot of water."

1,i used it for six months and it worked like a charm.  got through colds with out descending into sinus infections( the usual result).  then it stopped working!  it has never worked again.  how sad.  doctors had addicted me to nosespray in high school  the only other time i was symptom dree was when i was nursing.  this seemed like a godsend.  i wished it still worked' there were no side effects short of a slight tingling in the nose when using it. i had one spray per nostril bedore bed.  it kept my nose clear all night.

1,"the albuterol relieved the constriction, irritation and wheezing i experienced. it worked both as a preventive and as a curative measure for those symptoms. i have occasionally experienced exercise induced asthma (actually after i stop exercising) and taking the albuterol in advance helped alleviate that. i have experienced no side effects. i use the albuterol as needed because of allergies (seasonal, dust, exercise) and can go for long times without using it."

1,"my overall mood, sense of well being, energy level was increased with better sleep pattern restored. i also noted improvement in my facial firmness and skin tone. no side effects of any kind were noted or apparent from the use of this product. i have used bioidentical estrogen hormone divigel for  years plus and plan to continue. divigel is a topically applied bio-identical hormone ( estrogen) which i highly recommended. the product is applied topically at night to top of (leg) thigh. my benefits were improved mood, clarity of thought, increased energy, better sustained sleep, and mproved skin firmness and tone - even facial skin."
