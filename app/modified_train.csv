0,"although this type of birth control has more cons than pros, it did help with my cramps. it's also effective with the prevention of pregnancy. (along with use of condoms as well) heavy cycle, cramps, hot flashes, fatigue, long lasting cycles. it's only been  / months, but i'm concidering changing to a different bc. this is my first time using any kind of bc, unfortunately due to the constant hassel, i'm not happy with the results. i hate this birth control, i would not suggest this to anyone."
1,"i was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least  days.  the ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. definitely a miracle medication!! heavier bleeding and clotting than normal. i took  pills at the onset of my menstrual cramps and then every - hours took  pill as needed for about - days until cramps were over. if cramps are bad, make sure to take every  hours on the dot because the medication stops working suddenly and unfortunately takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick back in.. if cramps are only moderate, taking every  hours is okay."
0,"the acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. the heartburn started again as soon as i stopped taking it. so i began treatment again.  months passed and i stopped taking it. the heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. the doctor said i should try another  month treatment. i did, and the same exact thing happened. this went on for about three years. i asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. the doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". i was told that i would probably be on it for the rest of my life. constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days. i was given prilosec prescription at a dose of mg per day. medication was taken once, every morning before eating. each treatment duration was for  months."
0,"i think that the lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue. i felt extremely drugged and dopey.  could not drive at all while on this med.  also had extreme ankle and feet swelling and couldn't even wear shoes. see above"
0,"after taking propecia for over a year, starting when i was  years of age my hair continued to thin, and i noticed no significant benefits low sex drive, before i started taking this drug i was  years of age and full of ""enthousiasm"". now engaged and  years old, my sex drive is very low, my wife and i are very unsatisfied. i am also very tired even during peak hours throughout the day, and its hard to concentrate on mundain tasks one pill once daily"
1,"my mood has noticably improved, i have more energy, experience better sleep and digestion. a few experiences of nausiea, heavy moodswings on the days i do not take it, decreased appetite, and some negative affect on my short-term memory. i had began taking mg of vyvanse for three months and was surprised to find that such a small dose affected my mood so effectively.  when it came to school work though i found that i needed the mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  i had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the mg.  i find that the greatest benefit of vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before i was perscribed."
1,"although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. therefore, i have continued to take it for that alone. while i still on occasion have problems falling asleep, i find i can combine it with melatonin or valerian. in  years, i haven't had to increase the elavil dosage. none. one a day, taken about an hour before bedtime."
1,"this simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of ssri medicines. i won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which i sought help for many years after the fact. this just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. when taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. i find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment. i really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it - times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. at first, within the first  day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. once i got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from . mg -  times per day to what i'm on now things are so stable and just smooth. i first started taking this at  times per day with . mg pills. i was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. this is totally true. at first i wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. this really does work when you take it daily at - times per day. this way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. yes, i still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. i wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. this works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. people and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just works, rather than trying to give them ssri's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. and, the doctor's out there who decide that ssri's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!"
0,"none - did nothing to help allergies. i just had a dryer, more painful version of my allergies with new allergies/irritations developing on top of my original ones. this stuff is dangerous and the side effects that many people are experiencing are not listed on the package. a class action lawsuit needs to happen. i had some horrifying mental and physical side effects. ruined a year of my life.  read this - it mentions everything i dealt with: http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=&name=claritin took one  mg pill nightly."
1,"i experienced complete clearing of the vaginosis after the regimin was completed. i did get a mild yeast infection during treatment. i took the antibiotic as prescribed every day, twice a day, one pill each time. my bacterial vaginosis cleared up after treatment. however, i did have a slight yeast infection that went away with an otc treatment."
1,"smoother more gradual onset and effect than adderall. effective at controlling add symptoms previously controlled by adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. less tension and anxiety. less ""druggy"" unnatural feelings and thoughts. dexerine ir tablets need to be taken more often than adderall and also wear off more abruptly. generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets. switched from adderall to dexedrine to compare the effects. dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while adderall is a mixture of amphetamine salts. this might explain the increased effectiveness of the dexedrine contrary to popular belief. i found it important to take several relatively low doses frequently to achieve a balanced effect."
1,"i found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles. my sides effects were not noticeable and very mild.  i have noticed some lower libido while on fluoxetine, but no other noticeable side effects. this was prescribes to me for treatment for depression, seasonable disorder and hormonal irritability.   i have gone off this medication while pregnant, but have resumed to help ease depression issues."
1,"for the first time in my life i had enough lashes to apply mascara to.  i had tried eyelash extensions which only broke off or pulled out what few thin lashes i did have.  strip lashes were itchy and uncomfortable.  i now have normal lashes.
even though i only applied it to upper lashes the lower lashes have grown longer and thicker too. my upper eyelids were red and itchy for the first - weeks but that went away and i have not had a problem since.  my eye exams have been normal with eye preassure normal. for the first - weeks i used one drop every night applied to upper lash base with a small disposable brush.  after my lashes had grown in i started using it every - nights instead of every night and the lashes have stayed longer and thicker than prior to treating them."
0,"aldara did seem to crust up my previous skin cancer area and help minimize my scar from mohs surgery for skin cancer. due to the side effects i could only tolerate for one week opposed to  week regiman. i felt an out of it feeling, like a depressed feeling, i was fatigued and i broke out with severe blisters on and around my lips. i used / of a packet(% cream) on just my nose every other night and on alternating nights i put on an entire packet on my entire face."
1,"reduction in anxiety, no panic attacks.  drug is extremely effective no side effects while on drug.  super bad side effects while going off the drug.  google searched it.  lots of people with the same symptoms.  read up before you start it. took medication for  to  years.  very hard to get off this drug.  i liked the way my anxiety was controlled, but it also inhibits all emotional response (at least in my case).  i didn't have any mood, emotion, nothing.  it gave me a very flat affect.  also my doctor did not seem very informed toward drug side effects and withdrawl symptomologies."
0,"i'm taking gabapentin to treat nerve disorder. my nerves are inflamed and causes to experience pelvic pain and other pelvic disorders. the gabapentin sometimes works but i do experience relapse.

for the migraines
i find that the mg of ibprofen works better with no side effect for my migraines, but the maxalt has a better track record. i have no side effect while taking gabapentin but if i miss a couple of dosages or run out and wait for my next refill, i have moderate withdrawal syptoms. these syptoms include itchness, irrability, moodness, axiousness, and headaches.

maxalt side effect for  me is throat feels contristricted shortly after taking medicine. i take mg of gabapentin three times day. it seems to be effective but i feel i need a hire dosage as the longer i take it the more i experience relapses.i first started out with mg three times a day but it was ineffective."
0,"don't know yet back to pediatrician today my one year old daughter who has an awesome disposition (and always has) became restless and agitated. very touchy, aggressive, crying a lot, and having a hard time sleeping. also refluxing a lot and not nursing normally. it just dawned on me this morning it must be the medication. will request another antibiotic today from the pediatrician. thanks"
1,"very good at relieving anxiety.  good at generally calming me down and 'leveling me out' to make functioning easier.  helps a little to relax muscle tension.  calming effect makes an excellent sleep aid. fatigue can sometimes be excessive.  high dependency. used for general anxiety and as an adjunct for depression and chronic pain.  very good at alleviating any anxiety and jittery feelings.  'levels out' my mood but doesn't cause euphoria; i have no desire to take more than i need.  however i am very dependent on it; if i stop taking it for a couple of days i have bad nervousness and jitteryness, tachycardia, sweating, and other anxiety symptoms.  if i wanted to discontinue i would have to do _very_ slowly, but this is the nature of long-term benzodiazepine treatment."
0,"controlled the psoriasis, however did not reduce its presence. a ""halo"" a few shades lighter than the natural skin tone was present around the site of application, which would last about - hours. i found this time-consuming to apply - times daily.  also, due to the ""halo"" effect, it was a little precarious to apply as well."
1,"cure the ezcema and it took aout teh roughest of the skin skin redness and flushes, sometimes the skin eels like it is on fire, and you feel very ho.
it is also very itchy when the skin is heeling because of the drug, sometimes you even wake up in the middle of the night because of the itchiness. but this only happens the first few days, when the skins is very bad with ezcema, after a few days, when the skin is better you don't feel you have put any treatment in the skin, and it feels as any othe normal moisturiser cream to apply once a day afeter cleaning the skin, and avoid direct sunlight"
1,reduction of panic attacks and depression to almost nil nausea for first two weeks then no perceived ill effects started on a low dose (mg) and built up to mg over  months which was reduced to mg per day after six months. this dose continues today. a six month treatment break resulted in a return of the symptoms so treatment was resumed at mg up to mg after one month.
1,"i took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  my skin was not by any means awful, but i did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  the drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  my once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal. first, let me say that i didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  i did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  my face felt as if i needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  in fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  but the dryness was not nearly as bad as i expected.  for example, my lips never cracked.  however, i'm several years out from treatment , and i still have dry skin problems.  it's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  but that could be attributed to normal aging.  regardless, i've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  my skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  tazorac one percent, which i used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if i dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  i know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but i'm hoping for the best. i have to confess that i'm confused by this section.  there were no real ""details"" associated with my treatment aside from what i've alreay described."
1,"the treatment benefits included skin regeneration, and decreased acne.  my skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over. the side effects of the treatment included redness, dryness, skin irritation.  the skin was very dry and difficult to moisturize.  the skin looked red and irritated.   however, when i switched to a lighter skin cleanser, cetaphil, this really helped improve the redness and dryness.  prior to the cetaphil i was using roc cleansing pads which were too harsh on my skin. my routine included daily use of micro retin a pump.  i applied the retin a micro pump to my entire face at night after washing my face.  i used a moisturizer and sun screen in the morning."
1,fits settled down to maybe  a fortnight which were daily before this medication has gained quite abit of weight but as he has had problems gaining weight since being a toddler this isnt a bad thing givn by specialist after previous medicine epilim caused serious side effects still messing with dosage in the hope of getting his fits down to  but so far a vast improvement in seizures

1,"i had taken pulmicort, and other inhalants, with no major changes.  it became more difficult to maintain my exercise and lively life style. i gave in and began symbicort and immediately experienced a relief of shortness of breath, weezing.  i feel like a new person. i still have a reaction to cold wind, and very high humidity, but so much better.  i rarely use my albuterol. none i take one puff in the am, rinse my mouth and gargle.  i repeat the treatment in the evening before bed."
1,"i'm feeling more grounded; highs and lows are less extreme.  you could say that my emotional 'playing field' is more level. there's one 'side effect' - and i'm purposely and playfully/sarcastically placing it within quotes:  this stuff has increased my sex-drive manyfold! i don't know if this has been the case with other patients, and i'm curious to know if anyone else has had that experience.
i'm also presenting with a little 'feathery tickle', resulting in an annoying dry cough; perhaps this side effect will lessen as my body adapts to the medication. my doctor started me on a minimal dose ( mg) of lamotrigine, and this will be prior to starting interferon/ribavarin treatment for the hep-c i've got.  (an antidepressant may be added in the near future as well.) lamotrigine was prescribed to put me in a calmer state of mind, specifically because of the high anxiety effect i receive from antidepressants, which resulted in  visits to an emergency room - as well as a one month hospital stay due to extreme anxiety and paranoia.
so far/so good is this layman's analysis."
0,"it seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). the hard part is i can't seem to get off this stuff!! the withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. it scares me so much that i just start taking it again. i'm stuck!! don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. i don't know if i will ever be myself again. see above lyrica mg twice a day"

1,"alert, awake, focused dry mouth, decreased appetite i have only been on vyvanse for  weeks.  i started at  mg. and now at  mg. until next week where i will probably be upped to  mg.  i used to take focalin and then found out i was bipolar so had to stop that for close to a year to become stable on lithium.  i feel alert, awake and focused and feel vyvanse is very smooth and lasts longer.  hope i get the weight loss benefits eventually."
1,"my  bone density's results have always been stable and i was told to continue with the drug. leg cramps during the night. eight years ago i started with fosamax for - years and then took actonel.
in march, i decided not to take actonel any longer.   i had been on it for too long and was fearful of esophageal cancer and bone breakage.  now my doctor wants me to take the prolia injections, which i am not going to do. i am not going to continue with any drugs.   my bone density recently done was in the minuses.  i do work with a personal trainer and execise daily.  i am searching for alternative ways to deal with this problem."
1,"i was more alert during the first part of the day but i found that it wore off by the afternoon. i could focus clearly, and if i needed a boost during the day another dose was enough. it may cause some nervousness or restlessness. sometimes i felt like i had drank a large cup of coffee during its full potency. i took modafinil for cronic fatigue and general drousiness. i found it to be moderatly effective. 

in the morning after i would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced, however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and i would have to take another dose, but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time."
1,sleeping - hours without hangover memory loss it is a godsend. fully rested in the am and feel like a new person. i am convinced it has kept me from sliding into a full depression. it works on  levels for me: . my body gets rest so i can 'fight' for another day. . my brain heals. . i can endure a difficult day knowing i can take the pill and go to sleep. i consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression. wish i had it available to me years ago...could have changed my life. i would recommend to anyone in for a good experience while getting to sleep!
1,"i have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not ""flip the switch"" on sexuality.  i no longer feel like i am looking out of a dark room.  i have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before. a little bit of ""hyper"" feelings.  i take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if i did take it in two or more doses during the day.  i try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning. i suffer chronic depression and the wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  i have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as otc medications and dietary restrictions.  i have also tried ssris (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, ) the effect did not last more than  months, and ) they completely destroyed my libido."
1,"ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. so far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. i expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as i had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. in other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. so far, this has not occurred. the product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so i really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. in terms of halting the process, however, i must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. i will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, i suppose. i was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. this pressure would subside and i would go about my day. i'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. however, i've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. the sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but i would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around. overall, whether i am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. i presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which i filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. the formulation i was prescribed was  milligram, although i believe the usual prescription is for  milligrams and can go as high as  milligrams. my case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. however, other than the mild side-effects i described above, which subsided within three days, i must say overall that my experience has been a positive one."
0,"i have a-typical migraines which gives me weird sensation in my ears such as roaring and the sense that they are vibrating.  i also do have headacheds that seem to come from ears and the back of my neck.  it help me feel better and started to decrease my symptoms but side effects were worse than original symptoms.  it helped me to ignore my symptoms and helped me to get through the day. ringing in the ears, sensitivity to noise, phantom noise in head, which all lead to anxiety stopped medicine, looking for something else to help."
1,"migraine headache would stop dizzy, palpitations i have taken both the shots and the pills (separately) and they both worked well.  i would need to take the pills before getting sick to stomach, because if after, i could not keep pills down.  the shot worked regardless of when i took it."
1,"assists with getting to sleep and due to longer half life than other anxiolytics(ie alprazolam)anxiety is less upon waking. whilst alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal, i find lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.it has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication. as with all benzodiazepines withdrawl is very noticeable if undertaken quickly. lightheadedness, anxiety, dizzy spells, general feeling unwell.
in my experience the suggested half life in relation to reducing intake of these drugs is very misleading. reduction for me has to be done very slowly over a number of weeks not days as usually suggested by physicians. taken for anxiety,initially in an acute stage. this was followed by a decision by patient (myself) to continue for  months in order to reduce arousal levels whilst undertaking therapy using the theraputic model act."
1,"i had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  every dentist i saw  told me i was going to lose my teeth.  this drug  cleared up the condition.  it protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that i took it.  i continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. the effectiveness did not seem to diminish. none. a dentist in my dental hmo prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because i implored him to do so."
1,"relieves depression, helps other things such as sleep, dieting, exercise, relationships, responses to stimulous.  the cost is lower than other antidepressants which can be a help to those on a budget. sleepy and lack of response to problems.  took too long to get started.  i think anyone else would think it wasn't effective and stop taking it. took a seemingly long period of time to become effective.  once started, however, it did what i expected.  it is hard to be without now and think that it will be a problem stopping in the future."
0,"to stop with the migraines, seizures and pain from the fibromyalgia,also have neuropathy in hands and feet from diabetes alittle weight loss but i was thin already the worst thing was hair loss for me and the feeling of pins and needles in the feet got worse, the dr increased my dose from mgs t  mgs af ter four years because i had a few seizures ,and after only two to three weeks i had so many side affects ,i had not had in all of the four years that i had been taken the  mgs my hair came out,blurry vision,dehydration forgetfulness,you name it i had not delt with this before only read about this except for the hair and i have always had lots of it so you know how upset i was.. needless to say istopped taking the extra mgs and went back to my old dosage with hopes tha everything will goe back to where it was ,trying to get in touch with the dr. as i type now... does anyone know if the side affects will goe away? take two  mgs tablets in am when i was given the increase i was told to take two  mgs tablets in the am and  in the evening before bed"
1,the stuff works like a charm--fast and effective. none one pill  mins. before activity
1,"the drug was pretty good for pain. they had me on morphine, which was horrible. the pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia i had. they then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects. sleepiness, dizziness, light-headedness & nausea. i only took them when the pain was unbearable, so i might have gotten used to the side effects if i had kept the levels up in my system. i just took the pills every - hours when the kidney pain was too bad. i tried to only take them at night as the conditions improved since they made me sleep. i stopped takeing them long before the infections and colon problems were resolved, as i don't like takeing drugs."
1,"effective at controlling seizures without dizziness there were no side effects i took dilantin for decades.  my doctor moved me to trileptal; it was not % effective and caused dizziness, plus it was very expensive.  lamictal controls my seizures, although i still get headaches (auras).  i would like to be completely free of these headaches, but this is still better than previous medications."

1,"eventually cleared my moderate acne. had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after  months hair loss! not so much from my head, but other places such as arms etc. dry lips were the worst, tried many different products but eventually carmex solved that. dry skin slightly, not too much of a probelem. depression was bad, would have no motivation to do anything and hated everything around me. after stopping the drug this discontinued and i deem it acceptable to have, for the results of clear skin. i can't remember ever having the initial flare ups/breakouts other people have reported. i was warned about this by my dermatologist but i can't say i remember it. i noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. it was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. by the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. however the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. if you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made."

1,"the cream made the basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses react, scab up, and heal to nice smooth skin after about two weeks after treatment with the cream ended. i had no side effects.  some people think the ulcerated scabby areas are side effects, but this is what the cream is designed to do, make bad cells react and destruct. the cream is applied at bedtime for five nights a week for basal cell carcinoma.  three night per week for actinic keratosis.  you do this for eight weeks in a row.  by the end of eight weeks, the bad cells react gradually as scabby spots.  this is how you know the medicine is working.  you put the cream on the spots your doctor tells you to, with about an inch margin all around it."

i notice that i will usually gain a pound or two and the following week loose  or . sometimes i'll have  weeks of no weight lose followed by a week of pretty dramatic weight lose.
i would never have been able to lose the weight without using meridia to start off. i don't know if my stomach has shrunk or if i just have a better idea of how much to eat and what to do to lose weight, regardless i'm thrilled and couldn't be happier with the results!"

1,after  days of taking the medication my stomach pain subsided.  the burning i also began to go away.  it took a full week for everything to return to normal for mw. while i have been taking the medicaion i have not experience any side effects.  the only thing that bothered me was that it took about  dayss to see improvement which was not a long time but when you are uncomfortable it seems much longer. went to doctor because of burning and pain in my stomach.  as long as i was consantly full my stomach was better but the second it became empty i was back to being uncomfortable.  i want to get rid of these symptoms before i became over weight so i went to my doctor and he started me on  mg for  week and then i was changed to  mg once a day and after a couple of days i felt much better. and have every since.

1,"after  days on crestor,  mg. per day, in combination with changes to my diet, my ldl (bad) cholesterol fell from  mg/dl (high risk) to  mg/dl (optimal), a drop of nearly half.  my triglyceride levels were reduced as well. one side effect my doctor warned me to watch for was loss of muscle density.  i work out with weights usually three times a week.  i noticed no loss of muscle size, tone, or strength while taking crestor. because my ldl cholesterol was in the ""high risk"" range by american heart assn. standards, it was important to lower my risk level quickly.  in addition to taking  mg. of crestor daily, i made disciplined adjustments to my diet.  i cut out animal fats, including dairy fats (like cheese and ice cream).  i cut out trans fats (like partially hydrogenated oils).  i greatly increased my consumption of wheat bran and oat bran, and raw vegetables.  i also took  mg. of time-release niacin with my lunch each day.  once i got my ldl cholesterol down to below  mg/dl, my doctor revised my prescription to only . mg. crestor per day.  since crestor is not sold in this dosage, i must cut the pills in half.  i was tested again after  days at this dosage, and my ldl was still below  mg/dl.  and that was with a more relaxed diet."

1,face cleared up conciderably. it took about  months for the drug to become conciderably effective though. there were no side effects associated with the drug. the doctor mentioned it would make birth control ineffective but had no confirmation of that. face and body cleared up conciderably.  it did take a while for the drug to take effect - but was worth it in the end.  i am now pregnant and will continue treatments after i have the baby.  once i stopped taking it before i got pregnant - my face began to break out again. so you really have to continue to take it to keep the benefits.
1,"i liked this drug very much, because the stronger doses of antibiotics gave me horrible yeast infections. however, this one didn't quite so much. it still kept my acne at bay, and worked. i still got yeast infections, however, they were not as bad and easier to get rid of than with the mg anitbiotic. i took a  mg antibiotic for acne for about a year, then, because it was giving me bad yeast infections, my derm switched  me to oracea. i got a card with the prescription that made it free with my insurance!!"
1,"definitely lowered anxiety. didn't care as much as i needed to about deadlines and other stressful things. it was good that i wasn't overly anxious, but i also was less likely to work overtime to get things done.

0,"my pain and anxiety were considerably lower. i felt like any situation was controllable and i was much more effective at my daily tasks.  the panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. an added benefit was that muscle pain that i always seemed to have was also gone. i rarely had to take any pain meds. it seemed like a miracle. at first i seemed a bit hot. i sweat more often. then i began not being able to handle any stress at all. i began feeling like i needed other aids to help me deal with everyday stress and i have never needed anything before. then my stomach began to act up. i began having constipation or diarrhea constantly. never normal. i began throwing up and now my stomach does not digest food well at all. i also was unable to sleep, severe insomnia. i chose to take myself off the medication because the stomach issues have completely taken over my life and causing major disability. the side effect have intensified so much that i cannot function daily. severe dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and my mind has been having lapses. sometimes i cannot get out of bed. it has been over a week. mg once a day. i took every morning."
1,"i did go to sleep more easily. i'm not sure how effective the time release is, because i often would wake up - hours later. sometimes i didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at pm, would take one to go back to sleep. they say to not take unless you have  hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. the cutoff time is - hours. i sometimes feel groggy the morning after. the one time i took it nightly for  weeks, i had been under a great deal of stress, and then jet lag (i travelled to europe). in addition to the grogginess, i also just didn't feel good.very hard to describe, but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. for occasional use, it is better than the alternative, though i'm not sure i believe the time-release is worth the cost. next time i'll try the generic. the treatment details? i like to have it on hand, but not to use unless i can't get to sleep any other way. often, i go to sleep easily enough, but wake in the middle of the night. if it's -am, i will take one, and might be groggy in the morning, but i function better than if i couldn't go back to sleep. if it's after :am, i haven't tried it yet, because i get up early."

1,"i was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once i felt one starting.  this has been extremely beneficial to me.  i have gotten my life back.  i would have - migraines a week which would put me in bed for  days.  i would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  i was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  also i never knew when i would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  i felt very unreliable, which is not me.  i am a very responsible person. i have never had any negative side effects from imitrex. i take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting.  usually within - minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone.  once in awhile, at this point ( minutes after i have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different, so i will take another half of a tablet."
1,"migraine problem: i now only have rare occurance of migraines, less than once a year.  before prepro treatment i had a migraines almost continuously, and took frova at least twice a week. potential benefits is prevention or delay of osteoporosis, since my mother had severe osteoporsis. increased risks for breast cancer and conditions caused by clots like strokes. i take the prescribed dosage every day, get annual breast exams, pap and bmd tests.  i try to stay physically active and eat healthy foods."
0,"i sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  this drug really helped me to control my temper.  in fact, the temper became nonexistent.  i used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  however, this was the only benefit i experienced. i gained  pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  but - i have always struggled to gain weight - i weighed  pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy  with a lot of hard work.  in just the two months of being on lexapro, i went up to .  not being able to fit into any of my clothes during summer is not helping my depression.

immediately upon beginning to take lexapro, i felt ""high"" for about two weeks.  my doctor says ""that shouldn't happen because of the medication.""  well, i wasn't doing any other drugs, so i don't know what to tell you there.

possibly the worst side effect i experienced was a decrease in motivation.  if you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons i sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  i had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  well, within two weeks of starting this medication, i began needing long naps (+ hours) every day just to function.  i watched tv for the rest of the day.  i had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  it was a severe decrease in motivation.

also, i had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm. i missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so i have been off the lexapro for a week.  in that time, i no longer needed to take naps and although i still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels i experienced while on the drug.  my temper did come back, though.  the withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that i began throwing up and have had migraines ever since i stopped taking it.  (again, my doctor said ""this medication shouldn't do that. maybe you have the flu."")  last night, though, i had great sex with my husband and was able to orgasm easily.  

needless to say, at my doctor's appointment today i asked to be switched and will begin wellbutrin right away.  (oh, and i fired that doctor.)"
1,"for the first time in my life, i had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  i had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes i did have.  after several months of latisse i have eyelashes and even though i apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too. my eyelids became red and itchy for the first month of use.  it was bothersome but not enough that i quit using the product.  after about - weeks the redness went away and i have not been bothered by it again. i applied a single drop of latisse to a brush and ran it along the base of my upper lashes each night for the first  months and now just use it about every - days and my lashes have stayed longer and thicker even with less use."
1,"the wellbutrin with  mg of prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day. jitters, trembling hands. i had been taking prozac with other medications for  years and it had stopped working for me.  after being prescribed wellbutrin with it, i found i felt so much better.  however, when i tried to stop taking prozac entirely and stay just on the wellbutrin, my depression returned.  i have been on this cocktail now for  years and believe it has helped me immensly."
1,"along with the tamiflu, pretty much cleared up any problems i had except for my cough. it was not as bad as a cough, but was still present. it took about  days for the medication to actually work but it does a good job. metallic taste in mouth, back pain, and headache (only for a few days). nothing sleeping can't sure. went to my infirmary at my college, and was prescribed biaxin and tamiflu for my flu-like symptoms and pneumonia. told to take both tamiflu and biaxin until finished ( days for biaxin,  for tamiflu)."

0,my cholesterol was lowered by about  points. i did not seem to do anything else nor was it supposed to. there were no discernible side effects. i took the drug for a year and i did not notice any side effects or changes after i stopped taking the drug. i had high cholesterol and was considered to be at risk for heart attack. this drug was supposed to lower my cholesterol level which would reduce any heart plaque that might be building up in my arteries. i lowered my cholesterol somewhat but ultimately my diet did much more to change my counts.
0,"the treatment cured the sore throat for which it was perscribed. during the  days taking the drug there were no side effects, however the day after the last dosage, i began having severe diarrhea, which persisted and was diagnosed as a bacterial infection called clostridium difficil, caused by the antibiotic i had taken. i took omnicef orally for  days.  after the clostridium difficil was diagnosed, i had to start a new course of drugs which had to be repeated before the new infection/condition was cured."
0,"the treatment benefits for the cream tazorac were improved skin tone, appearance of reduced wrinkles on forehead, undereye area, upper lip and nose. the skin felt softer and pimples were not prominent. the side effects associated with the use of tazorac daily for the treatment of antiaging skin is severe dry skin, erythema or skin redness and severe flaking and burning of the skin. there was quite abit of tingling even after the gel had dried overnight. the treatment details for the skin gel tazorac was to apply it once a day, or in my case nightly to the face. not more than a small pea size of cream was directed however this was quickly absorbed into the skin and could not be applied over the remainging area of the face. caution was applied in ensuring that the treatment gel was not applied to mucosal areas. nevertheless it did radiate to areas such as the eyes and lips causing severe dryness and chafing."

1,"i took this medication, valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which i had experienced many times before - usually once a year.
the next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
by the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
on the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
by the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as i had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a  to  day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
this medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak. no negative side effects were experienced. take two tablets by mouth with water twice daily for one day."

0,"my overall cholesterol reduced to just over , but not ldl which still remained high within that total. this in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition. after several months with no side effects i suddenly had continuous bad muscular neck pain and stiffness (particularly at night) which got better when i stopped the statin. my cardiologist orginally prescribed atorvastatin and omacor (at my asking about omega  efficacy) due to my having a completed blocked artery in my heart (discovered on an ebt scan by my thyroid doc). i have since tried other statins but have not stayed on any of them very long due to lack of results in bringing down my ldl and side effects such as stomach pain."

0,"i found for me it was great for pain relief. also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs i had taken in the past, i was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and i felt as if i could function normally. in the beginning i had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. after about  months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. i also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch, but only for a second and only once in a while.  therefore, i decided that i would discontinue taking the medication.  that is when my problems began. i was told by my doctor and pharmacist that this was a non-addictive medication, but when i quit taking it the withdrawal symptoms were extreme.  i had cold chills,severe body aches, diarrhea, nausea, headache, heart palpitations, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, vomiting and depressed feelings. i got a refill prescription to gradually come off of it after that and it occurred once again.  i have never had substance abuse issues but after doing some research learned that it is opiate-based and highly addictive. i have never felt that kind of pain and sickness in my life and pray i never do again. i have heard similar experiences from others as well. i would not recommend this drug and do not believe that it is not addictive.  from now on, i will do my homework before i take anything else. i now use otc pain relievers and i encourage everyone who reads this to do the same before beginning treatment with tramadol or any pain reliever."
0,"chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  in the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  when patient stopped taking chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned. the side effects for patient were ) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and ) very disturbing and vivid dreams.  patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  this method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  as to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day. chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  as noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  this, however, may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months."

0,"i was not able to ascertain any benefits from being treated with this medication.  its purpose was pain relief, and i did not experience any alleviation of my pain. i did not experience any side effects from taking this medication. i was prescribed this medication after being seen by a doctor for a severely infected cat bite wound on the top of my left foot (which the doctor was concerned might become a systemic infection).  the foot and my entire left leg were very painful (especially upon movement), so the doctor had me take ultram er to help relieve the pain.  i was told to take  tablet daily as needed.  i did as instructed for two consecutive days and did not have any relief from my pain.  after i reported this to my doctor, she gave me a prescription for a stronger pain reliever (which did help)."
1,"i have slightly high blood pressure on the diastolic side. lotrel did a good job at maintaining good levels without increasing my pulse which i experienced with other bp meds. after introducing lotrel within two weeks i notices small red dots appear on my ankles which i thought was just a heat rash. i developed petechiae which is the bleeding of small capillaries in the skin or mucous membrane. it appears as round pinpoint sized dots that vary in colour from red to blue or purple. these dots most commonly appear on the legs but can appear all over the body. also an onset on acne developed on my back at about the same time which was quite severe, and i have never had acne related problems, even in my youth. currently my physician has taken me off of my bp meds to allow the petechiae to fade, and to ensure that the reaction was indeed related to the lotrel. it has been  days and slowly the rash and redness is mellowing."
0,viagra did help me in acheiving an erection after prostrate surgery. other methods that were offered were not as attractive at the  times daily dosage of viagra. dizzyiness and flushing of the skin. the side effects became worse the longer i used this drug. i became too dizzy to be able to drive and preform my job. i was given viagra to correct ed after a racial prostate surgery. the side effects vs. the benfits of viagra were not worth it.
1,"while taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. it was much lighter than before and only lasted  days instead of , which was normal before. i didn't experience any bloating. it's a very cost-effective method compared to three-month supply of normal  day cycle pills. i noticed a slight weight gain (about  pounds) and still had issues with breakouts on my face prior to starting my period. there was also breakthrough bleeding, although very slight, at the times when my period would normally hit. it's very easy to take one pill per day and only have one ""off"" week in three months."

0,"i didn't take the product long enough to evaluate the benefits. i quit because of side effects. very painful muscles, it took a while to even get them going in the morning. when my cholesterol was found to be slightly elevated, my cardiologist put me on lipitor. the first week was fine. the beginning of the second week i began to have sore muscles all over. by the end of the second week this was so bad i could hardly get out of bed in the morning. so i quit the lipitor (did not consult the doctor on this); in the aarp magazine (or else newsletter, not sure which) there was a question for the medical doctor about possible natural replacements for the statin medications and he recommended red yeast rice. i found a product with that and a few other cholesterol-lowering supplements (primarily coq-) ad have been taking that with no side effects. i am due for another blood test in a couple of weeks, so we will see how well it has been working."
1,"significant, but not complete, relief from symptoms (sneezing, itchy eyes, cough, hives) while exposed to allergens - cats, certain plants. works best as preventative, but also works fine for relief from symptoms. none at all. tried rx for this in place of over-the-counter claritin/loratadine. this worked much better for animal allergies. i only take it as needed - not"

1,"finally clear skin and less oil!  prior to accutane i had to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now i easily an go a day or two.   my face and back were perfectly clear. i would have spent my last $ on lip balm, even if i hadn't eaten in a week!  talk about dry and flaking!   don't even think about waxing.  i didn't know that you couldn't wax (it was  years ago and there was less information about it then) it ripped my skin right off!  scary.  about  ear after my first round i did another go with accutane because my acne had returned and now,  years later my skin is one again pretty bad.  unfortunately not bad enough for accutane.  i mus say however, i have never been as bad as i was before my initial treatment and my back has stayed perfectly clear since then. you have to really want it to get it!  for females it is a pain because you have to do two initial pregnancy tests and then continue ever month to get a refill.  they also monitor your blood for possible liver toxicity and your hdl levels.  it is one pill x daily."
1,"able to breath at night, less sneezing. i woke up with less nasal stufiness and felt clear headed. i also appreciated the moisturizing glycerin in nasonex. i have a extremely dry nasal mucosa so there was definitely a benefit to that. did not have any side effects  and i felt extremely good during the allergy season. i actually enjoyed the moisterizing glycerin in my nose. use in the morning and evening in the spring allergy season. continue to use even if symptoms disapear and  to  weeks prior to full blown allergy symptoms."

0,"there were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath. shortness of breath, weakness. singulair was intended to address my asthma and constant coughing due to allergic asthma; instead singulair made my symptoms much worse.  singulair significantly increased shortness of breath and fatigue--even during inactivity.  due to the worsening of symptoms, i only took singulair for two days.  unfortunately, it took a few months before i was able to get back to my baseline (where i was prior to taking the drug)."
1,"while taking xyrem, i slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds. some nights i felt significant joint pain, primarily in my elbows and my shoulders.  other nights i suffered night sweats so severe that i would have to change out of my wet pajamas.  on occasion when falling asleep i would feel very giddy, almost ""high."" lack of sleep severely impacts my mood and none of the other sedative medications that i had tried worked, so i tried xyrem with beneficial effects."
1,"when i started first taking it it was great. i would get up in the am no brain fog, and could work the whole day not being tired. by night time though i was exhausted. after a month or so i still get up early but by afternoon i am so tired i usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. i have not tried taking another in the afternoon. i have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference. i am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but i have started having major breathing issues. i have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. now i am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. i wonder if it is being caused from the provigil. i just take one mg every morning when i get up. if i do not take it i thought is why i would be so sleepy during the day. but now i get sleepy anyway. but the waking up early is great were as i could not get up before."
1,"the medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. i used to have panic attacks at times before i began using this medicine. now the panic attacks are few and far between. although i do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if i must i can with no problems. in social situations i am much more myself and can relax and have fun. i have had  mini-strokes. since i began treatment with xanax i have not had a single episode. i have had no side effects from the use of this medicine. when i first started the medication it would make me sleepy. after time this side effect past and i have no problems now. upon treatment i found that results were immediate. i have been told that this drug is highly addictive, however that does not concern me as my neurologist will keep me on this medicine for the remainder of my life."
1,"before lexapro i was so depressed i could not function. i forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. i had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. i had ""bouts"" of depression before, but was never treated. my separation and death of my mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what i could get myself out of. i was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost  lbs that i could stand to lose in  months), cried all the time. i started lexapro  months ago, almost . i began at  mg and it was upped to  mg. i feel like i am starting to have my life back. i laugh again (genuinely). i can get up for work, i can socialize. i still have days where i feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. i have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (i was always happy go lucky). i have no ideation anymore.lexapro is giving me my life back. it is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. i can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as i did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. it saved my life. i have some difficulty sleeping (waking up in the night). sometimes i have diarrhea, but not enough so it stops me from taking it. i have not had any weight gain, but do feel bloated sometimes. once in awhile i get a weird high feeling which passes very quickly. i have found  that i have to take it at night because of the sedating effect it seems to have on me, but that is not a problem. i was on  mg, and ramped up to  mg fairly quickly, which was like a shock to my body.. that  or  days were like a haze, but i stuck with it and it passed. i am on it for almost  months now and i am feeling much more like myself."
1,"there was a significant reduction in mouth pain. i was able to relax following periodontal surgey and not worry about family obligations and responsibilities. i had drowsiness, dizziness, ichy at night with some nausea and dizziness in the mornings. i was prescribed vicoden in case i had measurable pain following peridontal gum surgery. i was presribed to take the vicoden prn for pain every - hours."
0,"moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so i could function better in everyday life. none that i could detect. nothing noticeable. maybe just a bit more insomnia but i had that before taking zoloft. i went to my internist and told him that i wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . i had been on effexor for many years, awile ago. effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if i so much as missed a dose. perhaps it was a placebo effect, but i felt the zoloft working after about a week. nothing earth shattering,but noticeable."
1,"the patient saw effective acne control within  weeks.  she still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  at four weeks, her skin tone was even. dryness at the corners of the mouth was the major problem. i find if you apply moisturizer or a small amount of vaseline to the area prior to apply the differin, the irritation will resolve quickly. medication is easy to use, and high patient satisfaction."
1,"i stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. i never picked up another cigarette. the cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. i was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. incidently i lost  -  kgs within  weeks of taking the drug. there was a feeling of complete disassociation from reality, people, feelings. i felt as if i was depressed. however at the same time i experienced times of being unable to control any emotions, my mood swings were extreme and i was completly unable to stop some fairly manic expressions of emotions. this could have been the nicotine withdrawal, but continued for a two - three month period. i stopped the drug about three weeks before prescribed as i became tired of the inability to feel happy / pleased / content. i experienced mild episodes of anxiety, vertigo and breathlessness - as i was aware these were side effects they did not overly concern me. i took one  mg tablet for seven days, stopped smoking on the sixth day. as prescribed i took one tablet twice a day for six weeks. after consulting the doctor over my cncerns of the side efeects i took one  mg tablet a day for the next four weeks."
0,"over time, this drug caused a massive reduction in my ocd hand washing rituals. i also no longer had to avoid public places for fear of germs.  furthermore, clomipramine caused an immediate decrease in day to day anxiety and worry. inability to reach orgasm or ejaculate. dry mouth. i suffered severe depression and ocd.  clomipramine was not the first drug tried, but it was the only ssri to work for me. however, any benefits to ssri drugs are countered by the havoc they play on your sex life."
1,"the nuvaring has proven to be very effective for me. i have had a lot of problems with birth control throughout my life. having tried many if not all possible  birth control treatments, i believe this is the one that works the best for me. it is practical and very few side effects when compared to the oral contraceptives, iuds or  injections. so far, i have only experienced headaches around the time when i take out my ring. it is very easy to use, you insert it in the vagina, it stays in for  weeks and take it out for one to have your period. then put a new one in. very easy to use and the partner does not feel discomfort due to the ring."
1,"the benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. i have been taking this medication for over  years and i don't see any long term side effects associated with it. another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. if it is taken before menstruation, i won't experience any cramp at all. side effects are i occasionally experience heartburn and nausea after taking the medication if i do not take it with food. also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe, it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective, no matter how much i take. overall i'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. i only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. however, the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait, the less effective the medication is, regardless the dose of the medication."
1,"i would say that in general, i feel more happy since im taking effexor. i am more patient and less agressive. i was really irritable with a constatly ''under pressure'' feeling before. now i feel a bit less concentrate maybe but way more relax. the problem for me if my strange dreams. plus, my sexuality is not that good anymore because i can not have orgasum! thats not that cool... i take  pill . mg each morning, they will up me to  mg and i will see if i feel better than better."
1,"had generalized anxiety daily prior to treatment, and panic attacks that impaired ability to function normally and quality of life in general. medication did not completely eliminate feelings of anxiety, but did a great job of reducing them. taking the medication serzone, made it possible to rely on the medication xanax less and less, to the point only had to take it seldom as needed. noticed when skipping a dosage for - days, heightened anxiety returned. took  to  mg. of medication for  years for the treatment of anxiety."
1,"enables me to get on with my life and be mobile. without it my back and neck become ""stiff"" so i also combine taking the drug with daily exercise to keep myself as fit as is possible. my condition was inherited from my father. none that i know of. twice per day, with meals (morning and night)."
1,"as near as we can tell, this drug (which is intended for men with enlarged prostates) relaxed ureter muscles, relieving the sensation of kidney stone pain, and also relaxed bladder muscles that had caused painful urination. it made me drowsy all week; also sporadic dizziness.  chronic nasal congestion (stuffy nose) was also unpleasant. once kidney stones were ruled out as the cause, the choices were to ""wait it out,"" or to try this medication. directions were pretty straightforward---take the pill after a meal; don't drive if feeling dizzy or drowsy; drink plenty of water."
1,"reduction of pain, pain reduction was necessary in order to be able to withstand the pain of aggressive physical therapy, i reduced the frequency of use after the first  days to avoid secondary complications such as intestinal damage, constipation, etc. constipation, stomach upset this was re-hab following shoulder arthroscopic surgery"

1,"effectively controlled acid reflux.  before treatment patient had severe acid reflux which was not controlled by other medications.  after trying many other drugs the patient was prescribed protonix and it worked very effectively.  the patient was then able to eat regular meals with no ill effects. none.  there didn't appear to be any side effects to taking this prescription.  the one drawback was that it took time to dissolve and frequently there was discomfit prior to it dissolving. took medicine as prescribed, twice daily"

0,"marginal, not sure if recovrey was from the drug or from the infection running it's course. none; however, anxiety was a result because of the confusing way the dosage was explained.  here is the detail:
 tabs today, then  tabs twice a day for x days,  tab x daily x days, then  tab in am x days. chronic bronchitis-type sympptoms were treated, daily dosage varied and was confusing and difficult to administer.  not able to pinpoint if recovery came from the infection running it's course or from the drug.  no side affects, but anxiety taking a steriod in such an unusual way."

0,"apparently lowered cholesterol and blood pressure awful!  difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue.  weight gain. swollen knees, ankles and feet.  my knees were severely affected -- difficulty getting up and down stairs, could not get out of a car by myself.  when i stopped taking the drug, my knees improved to the point where i am freely ambulatory, but they are still stiff with some pain.  i have had to consult an orthopedist, who tells me he has seen many such cases.  x-rays show i have the knees ""of a person  years younger,"" but the muscles have been grossly affected. in place of the caduet, which i stopped against the objections of my internist, i am using natural substances such as policosanol, coq, and pycnogenol.  i am also losing weight, and have professional therapy to try to regain strength in my knees."
1,"the drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.i only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.valium works instantly and i never had any problems at all with it. i do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects. none to speak of except for slight tiredness. to be taken  times a day, but i only took as & when necessary."
1,i started out with  mg twice a day and after about  years i've had to increase dosage to  mg in the morning and  mg at bedtime. it seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but i have never been able to just take it once a day but i've also had arthritus for + years. unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. this mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what i want to do. i haven't really had any noticeable side effects. see above. i am concerned thaqt the dosage might have to be upped after a few more years.
1,"my skin cleared up and my pores shrank significantly. my skin looked flawless. my pores have remained smaller long-term (+ years post treatment). my skin got very dry, including my lips. i had to use a significantly heaver moisturizer and lip ointment to keep my skin/lips from cracking. i had monthly lab work and doctor's visits to make sure i was having no ill effects, which i did not. i suffered no psychological symptoms or depression, in fact i felt less depressed because my skin looked so much better.

i would encourage patients and doctors not to be so frightened of this drug. it's a serious drug and bears monitoring, but lots of drugs are. i tried retin-a and that made my skin look and feel horrible, as did other topical treatments. the benefits to your skin and your self-esteem make accutane worth consideration if other treatments have not been effective."
1,relaxed tired taking zoloft once a day if you are really depressed may work wonders. but try to gat off of it as soon as possible. long term side effects are still not known.
1,"i suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that i did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids. taken daily, prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like i was over medicated. the side effects were so severe that i often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap. prior to taking prevacid, my symptoms required daily doses of anti-gas medications and occasional antacids. although prevacid was very effective, i discontinued use of it and switched to over the conter zantac because of the side effects. as a note, i am very sensitive to medications and often experience side effects from different medications and thus refrain from any unless experiencing severe symptoms."
0,"without question, actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  it is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
the flavor is also quite pleasant. actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than  months. actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  it needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
my  chronic  pain condition was followed by a pain center at a reputable hospital.  the use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
unfortunately, once actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  i was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever i didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  i became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age  lost  molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" i was taking.
i had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  fortunately my husband and i were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
i have no memory of  years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, actiq.  
believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and i am able to care for my husband and children, and work!  after my experience with actiq i no longer believe in the use of pharmaceutical products as a whole, and owe my good health to diet, exercise and several natural supplements.  i have never felt better in my life!"
1,i have been taking meridia for the last  weeks and have lost  lbs.  it has decreased my appetite and i am not thinking about food all the time.  combined with diet and exercise this has helped me out a lot. the only side effects that i have experienced so far is the dry mouth and the odd time i have a mild headache but that has since passed. meridia combined with diet and exercise has made loosing weight a lot easier this is the boost that i needed to change my life style.
0,"no impact whatsoever.  it was like i wasn't even taking anything.  the otc ibuprofen i was taking before my doctor appointment was more effective. none.  seriously, i could not even tell i had taken a drug, there were no impacts whatsover, either positive or negative. took  tablets ( mg) total, once daily in the morning.  also took zanaflex, but only at night.  the zanaflex helped - for about  hours.  when i was just on the meloxicam, i was in terrible pain.  the injury being treated was mid-back pain, caused by straining/overusing my back muscles in a ski competition.  i have a  day prescription for meloxicam, but i'm calling the doctor tomorrow to ask for something different; this drug is totally pointless for me."

1,"-prevented pregnancy perfectly
-enlarged breasts
-regulated periods
-lighter flow during menstrual cycle
-cleared skin for (moderate) acne for the first month, there was slight depression/moodiness, but that may have been due to the fact my body was adjusting to being on birth control i've been on ortho tri-cyclen for a year now, and have had little to no problems with it. before going on the pill, i would have awfully irregular periods, and very bad cramps the first day of my cycle. since going on it, my periods have become light, and regular. my breast have gotten larger, and my skin has cleared up. this pill is great! this being said, my results may have been so wonderful because i make absolutely sure that i take it everyday at the same time.

0,i no longer had seizures. i was having a seizure everytime i ate food. my sizure responce was food. my appetite increases. i gained weight i was tired all the time. i also had balance problems i also had periods of nasuea i was givin an eeg. from that point my doctor decided i needed a fairly high dose it took  days before enough tegretol had built up in my system before the seizures were under control.
1,"after trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed zestoretic.  zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of / from /.  the difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  after experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic i began watching my sodium intake.  i avoid any food that contains  or over mgs of sodium per serving.  this pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  after  months of watching my sodium intake i have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt none i take two tablets once a day at breakfast."

1,"i became more active and lost  of the  pounds i had gained.  i have more energy, and feel like myself again. i never had any side effects.  the only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  however, they prefer you take it in the morning.  so what i do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time i wake up in the morning whether it's , , or  am. i returned from vacation in august by november i had gained  pounds.  i did not know why.  i was eating the same amount of food.  i went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found i had a low under active thyroid.  as i think back, i did feel more tired, i did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead i would go to bed early.  that is not like me.  i am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  i thought i was just tired.  now, i reflect and remember that i stopped doing things with my family, became less active and all along i thought it was because i was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off."
1,"completely controlled nausea and vomiting. some sleepiness i was dealing with unrelenting nausea and vomiting for about five months.  a combination of other drugs was tried, and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. i had lost a lot of weight, and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. when zofran was added to the list of drugs i was given, i had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  i now take zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   i recently had a biopsy where i had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  the prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting, and my friend reminded the nurse that i usually used zofran for that.  within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and i was able to get much needed rest."
1,"i was only sleeping around  hrs per night. i felt sleepy all the time. i had episodes when my whole body would ache, every joint and muscle. it felt like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing it until my eyes would pop out i started craving carbs. i gained weight but i didn't care because i was feeling really good. as the years went by, i had to keep increasing and was up to mg. i had very dry mouth, i got to where i couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. i had to have a bottle of water next to me all the time, and i chewed gum constantly. i had to take laxatives every  days. i was so sick of it, i went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. she thought it might be the amitriptyline, so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me mg of cymbalta to start. i went down to mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. not sure how the cymbalta is going to work since i've only taken it  days now, but i'm hoping it works. i started with mg.  i noticed a difference after just one week. it worked really great. i was able to sleep with no problems at all. if i woke up for any reason, i'd just fall back to sleep right away.  it was a lifesaver to me. i wish i could still take it."

oh, and sometimes, like when i travelled to dry locations, i had to stop treatment temporarily , or had severely dry and peeling skin.  i have since discovered vaseline as a great preventative for that ! :) see above (included in above answer)"

0,"a more positive outlook and much easier social interaction.  introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  it was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes. a total loss of any sexual sensation.  prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
the worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  it took at least  months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and i was on a low dose.  any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement. just the one pill each morning.  this medication is such a double-edged sword that i could not recommend it.  the long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great, as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.  it really 'rewires' your brain and those effects may be unpredictable from person to person."

1,"helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and i didn't have any attacks. barely any despite some slight confusion. this medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it. if people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

i started having panic attacks when i turned , and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. a year later, i couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. i tried counseling and medications like zoloft and lexapro. the side effects from those made me feel worse than i did just not taking them.

finally my doctor decided to put me on alprazolam as-needed. 

it has been a life-saver for me. i would take the lowest dose (. mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. i visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything i used to do before my disorder. i finally felt like i had my life back. i would take one whenever i anticipated a situation where i could have an attack, or when i felt one coming on already. sometimes i didn't even need all of the . mg and could break it in half. 

too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

i *much* prefer this medication over any of the ssris, which have horrible side effects. i felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. the doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel  times worse than you did before. it's just not worth it.

. mg of alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. i highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term ssris that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. i have seen  counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all i did was waste a $ copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet.

1,"after about two weeks of being on the medicine, i started to feel a little better but i think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. the medicine has helped me by the following:

1,"taking lexapro has become a staple in my life.  i come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  without some kind of anti-depressant i literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  therefore i take  mg prophylactically of lexapro long-term.  i would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  i do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means. the side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  i am drowsier on this drug than i was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  however, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells. i have tried  mg per day in divided doses ( mg a.m. and  mg before bed at night) as well as  mg per day administered once in the morning.  i prefer the  mg although the  does work a little better as long as i divide the doses.  i am staying at  because i would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  i was happier overall on  mg however.  oddly enough, taking  mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and i found myself crying more.  all in all the best for me is  mg with half in the morning and half at night.  however, for long term use i prefer to take  mg just once per day at night."

1,"treatment benefits are stabilized thyroid.  was having a weight issue, and with a blood test it was determined that the thyroid gland was ""sluggish"".  i was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue. dosing is extremely important as it takes many blood tests to determine correct dosage.  not having the dosage quite right will basically result in the same symptoms that you are having issues with.  i have suffered basically no significant side effects other than that. pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  it is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  symptoms that i experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  it's taken awhile to get the dosage correct, and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company, i feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others i had been taking for  years."

0,"i saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. i believe it exacerbated my acne. on the mornings after the nights i used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst). side effects included:
- stinging & pain
- peeling
- pinkness (exacerbated rosacea) the cream was supposed to minimize my acne, but i think it did the opposite. just putting the cream on was very painful & stung up front. 

at times, my face would peel for entire days (again primarily on the chin - or entire jawline area).

1,"the treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  this estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  i felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  i love this medication. the only side effect i have experienced is that the patch leaves sticky stuff on your skin.  the adhesive can be very difficult to remove. vivelle dot is an estrogen replacement patch that is placed on the abdomen every  / days. it comes in several dose strengths.  it has significantly reduced my headaches due to hormone replacement.  he is also great for people who have trouble remembering to take a daily pill.  i highly recommend this product."

0,"the only benefit i received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. my sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately - times per month. excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  i felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug. the plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  my physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, i needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  each bottle contained a  day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  i have  herniated discs, one at l-l and the other at s.  the herniation at l-l was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  for me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if i had continual pain i would learn to live with the side-effects.  i did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.  it appears that eventually i will need to take medication but i want to avoid feeling ""doped up"" for as long as possible."

1,"my legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about  times per hour, that's once a minute.  sometimes it would wake me up and other times i didn't even know i was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  while taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about  times in a  hr period.  all documented on sleep studies. i've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  not a joke.  but i have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  i am not a gambling person. in fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and i've never had trouble or side effects at all unless i suddenly stop taking it and then i can't sit still or sleep becuase i am jumping around. i take a .mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner i take another one.  this keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because i used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or i'd feel the need to move.  i also take  mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  this has improved my quality of sleep immensely."

1,"upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that i had to remind myself to eat during the day.  it also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  i felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over. at first when i started the phentermine, it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  i also had trouble falling asleep at first if i didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. these side effects all diminished after about a month of usage. first i had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  i was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. i also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   they also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but i did not take those since i hate having to take any kind of pills.  overall i am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when i feel myself getting off track again."

1,"eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy. slight stomach naseau if not taken with food. i set my quit date for  week after i started taking the medication, but did not get discouraged when i was unable to meet that goal because i noticed a drastic decrease in my cravings and knew that i could eventually beat this addiction with the help of chantix. i reset my quit day for  week beyond my original date and by my second quit date, i was no longer craving a cigarette. i was able to quit smoking after only  weeks on the medication. i no longer craved one when i woke up, after i ate or when i got in my car. it was amazing and i like to call this my little miracle drug. =)"
0,"i did not get pregnant while on the depo shot... but then again my sex life was shot due to the constant bleeding. side effects were horrific. i gained weight, developed horrible acne, and i was severely depressed the entire time. when choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill, lightening or stopping my periods, and the guaruntee of contraception. boy was i wrong. all of the previous side effects were bad enough, but after the first month on the shot, i continued to have my period for nearly  months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. the worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot, there is no going back. i highly recommend a different birth control. i am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint. much better choice if you are looking to avoid pills. :) i recieved the shot at family planning about  years ago. please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug. my experience was the hardest  months of my life both emotionally and physically."

1,"personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within  days, and aided my mind alot.

within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my a* papers and my mental health.

with that i have only this to say:
take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  this will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries. the side effects are the same as the benefits to me.  mg  times daily

0,"the drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the   months it didn't seem to work anymore. definitely lower my libido. sleepiness when i first started taking it. i just had to take the medication, there was no suggestion on counseling."
1,"after the first two shots i had no more periods until after being off depo provera for nearly  months. also i didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. before getting on birth control i had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom i really didn't want to fight. on the shot i still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong. after getting off the shot it took nearly  years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (depo was my first experience with birth control). there was mild weight gain, once i started dieting and exercising i was able to deal with it though. some mild acne but nothing anyone besides me ever noticed. i'd visit the doctor's office once a month. at my original clinic, i would simply walk in and a nurse would inject me; after we moved to another state i learned i would have to wait .- hours for a doctor to see and inject me, even with an appointment it could take a while. once i had received it though i was good to go for  more months."
0,so far so good. will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. one area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. no inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before. i was told yeast infections are a common side-effect with antibiotics. i noticed the beginnings of one after about four weeks so i started eating two  oz low-fat organic yogurts a day and i haven't had that problem again. one year low-dose doxycycline. about five months into the treatment.
0,"i started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  in fact, my skin was worse. i've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  so i stopped taking the solodyn. i haven't taken solodyn now for a week and i am experiencing very itchy skin, achy joints, and fatigue.  the itchy skin is mostly on my scalp and neck. today i had itchy hives on my leg as well.  the joint pain is mostly in my right hand and wrist. it hurts to make a fist and then open my hand back up. i've had allergic reactions to other meds before, but they would stop when i stopped the medicine.  for some reason, these nasty side effects are lingering. none"
1,"suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

) it eliminated the opiate withdrawal when i was kicking my original drug of choice.

) as a maintenance drug, suboxone eliminates the cravings that i would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (heroin, oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) i can take suboxone and move on with life. 

suboxone may have quite literally saved my life. my only major complaint is that since suboxone is an opioid (though different from heroin, oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

due to suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. if i came in to the er with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. though this hasn't been an issue for me yet. i am a drug addict, and although i went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs i just couldn't seem to stop. so i went on suboxone, which is a new alternative to methadone treatment.

while methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the methadone lasts so long. but methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can still use drugs while on methadone if they choose too, it is extremely difficult to get off of, and methadone still gets users high.

suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the opiate receptors enough) and it's really not all that hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are very manageable)."
0,"i could not see any benefits. i certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before. this medication plunged me into experiencing menopausal symptoms. i took a blood test and my gp told me that i was not menopausal and gave me under arm deodorant which stung for the excessive sweating. my skin became extremely dry. i have no more natural vaginal secretions. my hair became very dry and i am experiencing small bald patch sin the front hair line.my sleeping pattern is absolutely awful. i look tired and haggard all the time, with enormous eye bags.the pain in my knees became a lot more severe i was prescribed this medication when the medication i had been taking for  and a half years became ineffective. i was not informed of any side effects. every time i went to my gp to discuss symptoms which i was worried about, they just patronised me.

i no longer take any medication for my condition and although i do not consider myself to be well, some of my symptoms have reduced. the others such as incontinence, dry skin, lack of natural seretions, i am just trying to live with or trying to find products which i hope will one day help me."
1,"this treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  although i didn't miss any dose times, if i had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  if the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage. i've experienced no side effects with this medication as in opposition to some others which have given me problems, especially stomach discomfort/upset.  i do usually follow-up with yogurt or another form of pro-biotic after prescription antibiotics. take  tablets the first day by mouth; then, one tablet on days -.  don't take medicine within one hour before or two hours after aluminum or a magnesium-containing antacid.  finish all of the medication, even if symptoms of the illness disappear prior to full prescription time demands in length.  store medicine @ room temperature, away from heat and light.  medicine may cause sensitivity to sun; avoid exposure to sun.  notify physician if swelling, rash or hives, breathing difficulties become present.  do not do anything that could be dangerous (ex:  driving, operating machinery) until you know how this medicine will affect you."

1,"i needed to switch from straterra which made me very very depressed quiet and i slept for like an hour each night with that drug it was horrible. i switched to vyvanse and the first time i took it, it was like an anti deppresant at first i was the normal happy hyper me but i could still focus very well on studying but when i started comming down from it that was the worst i was dry heaving with a terrible headache for an hour and then i would just throw everything up it made me very irritated i would twitch alot and my heart beat was fast and very heavy but after my second day my body started getting use to it and i havent had anymore problems with it. throwing up alot, bad headaches, twitching, crazy heart beat, loss of appetite (which is a plus in my eyes), and happy thoughts (like ""wow im soo beautiful"" for some reason would pop in my head alot), as well as some negative thoughts and worrying about homework constantly which is fine to because i would get it all done. so far the throwing up has stopped and the headaches come and go no food even looks good to eat no cravings very easy to diet ;) and passing all my finals was amazing. this drug makes strattera look like tylenol!"
1,"it allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that i could not ignore before. basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore. getting on the drug was tough, because i endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  after about - weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  i did have some weight gain, but i was really skinny to begin with. i've dealt with anxiety since i was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  it continued to build until i was  and i had a major panic attack, which i could not calm down from.  my psychiatrist put me on paxil cr and i worked up to  mg.  the dosage made a big difference, though i still had moderate levels of anxiety, but i could function.  about a year and a half ago i was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about - months, then i upped my dosage to . mg and within a week i felt fine, even better than i felt before.  now a year and a half later, i found myself in another relapse and after a week i released that all this time i was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  so my psychiatrist agreed that i was not at my ideal dosage and i am now taking two  mg in the morning which equals  mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on  to even  mg.  i just started taking it, so i should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  i've accepted that i may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.  i look at is as nutrition for the brain, or like taking insulin for diabetes, it allows me function and enjoy life."
0,"at first, could actually sleep. the sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  as stress increased, nothing helped,not even the ativan. loss of energy.  huge increase in anger and irritability over seemingly non-issues.  personality changes to being more depressed and pessimistic.  world view was negative, and everyone was an 'asshole'.  did not want to do anything or try anything or go out.  not even things normally that were turn ons ie. movies, dancing, sex, food
after -months on the drug, it helped not at all and sleep was down to - hours per nite. very simple, just take drug at night before bed.  doctor prescribed for no more thatn  nights per week, but as sleep deprivation increased, so did the taking of the ativan.  sublingual helped better than pill.  took drug up to  nights per week.  
ran out of ativan at some point and realized after a - days that was sleeping better and felt better mentally, emotionally and physically.  realized that the drug had severely affected his personality and motivation.  sex drive and pleasure increased with each week off the ativan.  swore to never use it again because the difference in how he felt was like night and day, once he got off the pills."
1,"my symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  i felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. i stopped feeling sad and crying. i was able to concentrate again.  my appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized. the drug made me nauseated the first month i took it. the only other significant ongoing side effect i experienced was constipation. i began taking effexor xr when i was severely depressed. i took it once a day for approximately five years.  my symptoms included crying, lack of interest in life, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and sleeping more than usuual. i could barely get out of bed and i could not function. within two weeks of beginning treatment with effoxor, i began to feel take more of an interest in normal activities and was able to eat and sleep normally."
1,"i had severe hot flashes all day and night. the night episodes kept me awake most of the night with alternating hot, sweaty flashes, followed by teeth-rattling chills.  prempro eliminated the vast majority of episodes so i could sleep there were no side effects that i was aware of i took  pink pill each day, in the morning after breakfast."
1,"the darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half i began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and i needed more. after my two weeks were up on taking it, i gradually just didn't need it any more. during treatment i would get very weepy and depressed any time i was awake.  of course i slept for hours after i would take it.  other than those two things there were no side effects. i had surgery for endometriosis that left me in the hospital for over a week.  the doctor had to cut my stomach totally across the bottom to rid my body of the diseased tissue.  i'd been on morphine in the hospital, then came home taking the darvocet for the next two weeks."

1,"the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that i normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods, coffee, chocolate, tomato products, and alcholic drinks, which i only drink occassionally such as red wine.  if i skip the prevacid for any reason, i almost certainly will be very uncomfortable. it seems to give me a tendency to gain weight in the abdomen.  i did try some alternatives, including nexium, which was not a good substitute at all! i have been on prevacid for approximately  years as a a prophylactic against the pre-barretts.  i have tried to slowly come off the drug (it is the only one i use) but i would venture to guess that unless i changed my diet significantly, this is not going to happen."
1,"i very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
the abrasion was so small that i didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
over the next  days the are became inflamed and i began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
on the th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
i immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
the drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within  hours. the drug upset my stomach mildly. otherwise no side effects noticed. i was given a  day prescription which is the reason i am submitting this report. 
i believe antibiotics should be prescribed in a course of  -  days. 
this practice as far as i know was very popular in hong kong and it still might be general practice.
in my case i did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as i was not covered by medical insurance at that time.
instead i went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics i received from the doctors office and asked if i could buy  tablets. they were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost i paid at the doctors office) and i followed through with a  day course.
the results were very positive and within  hours i could feel relief and i knew that the infection was being affected by the amoxilin. by the rd day the swelling was greatly reduced and other than a nasty wound on my ankle bone i felt very good. i continued the remaining  days and besides a scar on my ankle at the site of the infection i completely recovered."

my experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

hope this helps and gives encouragement. for me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
since taking the drug once daily i have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak i increased the dose to   tablets a day twice a day day for four days. this treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which i felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within  hours. to be honest i have had no side effects that i can determine.  tablet a day in the morning.

1,"it has totally neutralized the effects of my reflux. no side effects encountered. i started getting reflux after i had gall bladder surgery when i was . i had tried just about every reflux drug out there, but they either didn't work or had unacceptable side effects. when i first tried protonix i couldn't believe how normal i felt within a couple days. it works so well for me, i forget i have reflux sometimes. i haven't noticed any issues with foods or coffee since taking it."
1,"after i built up a tolerance, i had little peeling when i applied it only once a day. used in combination with erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), i have been able to control deep acne cysts. while the erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the retin-a is a good addition. peeling which can chafe the skin and interfer with putting on face makeup. however, i have built up such a tolerance, i would have to apply retin-a - times daily to achieve major peeling. it is hard to measure the anti-aging effect, as i don't know what i would look like without having used retin-a. i use once at night. because i have built up a tolerance, i have no adverse side effects. if i do have occasional peeling, i remove/stimulate it with a buff puff."
1,"relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea. side effects were minimal.  i'd feel tired/lethargic following the initiation of it's effects, but the fatigue might be related to the migraine headache rather than the drug (??).  i would sometimes get a ""rebound"" migraine headache of decreased intensity approximately  days after the treatment. relpax was prescribed on an ""as needed"" basis for my migraines.  it was taken after the onset of migraine, usually when i realized that it would not go away via conventional over the counter headache medicines.  it starts to take effect at approximately - hours after i take the pill.  this medicine has been a ""life saver"" for me.  it allows me to function and go on with important things in my life even when i get a migraine."

1,"in comparison with other antidepression medications i have taken prior to the effexor, it actually began working faster than the others (after about  weeks).  most antidepressants usually take closer to  weeks to see improvements. depression symptoms were significantly reduced. i experienced moderate constipation as well as excessive night sweating.  would become completely drenched in sweat during sleep. also experienced sexual side effects (low libido). the thing i really don't like about effexor is that if i miss a day for some reason, i begin to experience feelings of dizziness within  hours.  mg daily"
1,"had surgery on my neck, the lortab reduce the pain.the lortab help relieve th pain upto eight hours so i did not need to take as many pills to find release. this is a good thing because i do not like pills.  this medication helped tremedously. a little nausea. this medication has a high risk of addiction. when you take it be very careful that you do not misuse. the lortab reduces the pain on the first pill however as you take the medication it seems to take more pills as you go along to recieve the same releif as first. take one to two tablets by mouth every  hours as needed for pain."
1,"my moods have improved dramatically.  i would wake at least  times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  i originally took premarin which gave me headaches.  the patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches. the only drawback to using the patch is a mild allergy to the adhesive.  sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath, so i've had to pull out a new one.  i do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form, or at all, but with a uterus it is necessary.  i'm also concerned about long-term effects. i originally began using hrt  years ago to help with very severe menopausal symptoms.  i had tried all the natural remedies as i was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs, soy, etc.  i walked  miles a week and did yoga, none of which helped.  in desperation i visited my ob gyn who suggested i go on hrt, stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  shortly, thereafter, the reports initial study was released, and again i spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  i switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective, and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  i've since weaned myself off several times, only to have the symptoms return.  i'm concerned about latest studies and have thought about weaning myself off again, and then think, ""quality of life""."
1,"while standing, my legs were fine, but aching, cramping legs were keeping me from getting any sleep.  my doctor suggested i try requip, and its been the best thing i have done. i have experienced no side effects, except sleeping at night.  the warning says that it might make you drowsy, but that's also why they say to take it at night. i take requip about -/ to  hours before bedtime.  it permits relaxation of legs so i can sleep."

1,"the benefits of celexa have been surprising and welcome.  over the passt  years i've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that i couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  one (i can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about  weeks i was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any i'd experienced before.  i stopped taking it. the side effects i experienced with celexa were heart palpitations during the first few weeks of taking it, which later subsided.  yawning was also a side effect, but it went away after a couple of months. i take  /  mg. tablets of celexa once a day."
1,"restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  both issues disappeared when i started taking restsis.  there was a short period where i ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when i resumed treatment. there were not any side effects. - eye drops twice a day"

0,"benefits were the pain relieving benefits side effects were a little troubling to me.  although the pain was not diminished completely, i noticed that when i had severe pain, the meds did absolutely no good.  perhaps if i'd taken more than the recommended dosage, it would have been effective, but i did not want to do that.  it also had a negative effect on my brain.  i could not think clearly, i felt like i was in a fog.  i also spent alot of time sleeping which was another side effect i did not like. took this med following surgery for pain control."
0,"no apparent benefits.  had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use. extreme drowsiness, weight gain. had virtually no effect on my depression and the side effects were intolerable.  took it at bedtime but was still quite groggy throughout the day.  gained about lbs before i stopped it."

0,"the xanax has a calming effect, and takes the edge off the effexor side effects. the effexor actually makes me feel worse. i started with  mg,  per day. was increased to  mg per day. my emotions are blunted and flat. my joy for living is gone. i'm having some concenttration problems, and short term memory loss. so i'm going back to dr. to see what else is out there. i've heard bad things about cymbalta and pristiq, so i'm just confused as to what really works. effexor xr  mg.  times per day, at present.  hoping i will find something to help. i don't even know what drug to suggest.  i've been on prozac, and zoloft. the zoloft worked for  years, and it just stopped working also. tried paxil for short term. it made the anxiety worse for me."

1,"subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as vicodin, oxycodone, and even heroin. however, i was started on subutex because my doctor and i were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of effexor xr and adderall (which were only partially working). my doctor had found research suggesting that subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. my doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! i have had almost all good results from this medication. it has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. the following are the benefits that i have noticed from taking subutex:
     . quick-acting - because subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     . gentle effects - i have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     . also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     . have not noticed any of the side effects that i have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. also, in case anyone is worried that subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", i must emphasize that this med does not build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. i have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. however!!! you must understand that - as is the case with all psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. the one saving grace about subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication. none. i take two mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve. i do this again at night as i get into bed. that's pretty much it!"
0,"it assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief. i had no side effects. i have severe tension headaches on a every other day basis.  occasional swelling in the top of neck. if ibuprofen didnt do the job, fiorinal usually topped it off.  but this medicine alone didnt do much for me. i was prescribed  to  pills every  hours when headaches occurs."
0,"i originally began this treatment for acne and i'm still in the process of my acne treatments. however, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, i went in for a pap smear and found out that i have asymptomatic chlamydia. i was prescribed  gram of azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage i've been taking of doxycycline for - weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me. there was one morning i only had an  calorie granola bar for breakfast and i took my dose and i ended up having terrible nausea. will never make that mistake again. so far my acne has improved. i'm hoping it goes away, my main message is to point out it did not treat my chlamydia."
1,my hair loss was stopped and i eventually grew new hair at the hairline and where the hair had receded on the side. i do not know if it affected my crown. i noticed a slightly lowered libido and possibly a more slowly growing beard. my libido seems to be back to normal. i have to take mg/day to stop hair loss. i did not notice results until recently after having taken it for  months and i am hoping to notice even more once i have been on it for a year.
1,"i took it before bed, and it helped me get to sleep. it also helped me cope during a difficult time emotionally. the drug is an anti-depressant. the side effect was sleepiness, which is also therapeutic when taken at night. ongoing treatment for several years with  mg at bedtime."
1,"elminated % of migraines/headaches! within about - min, i start feeling mild tingling in my throat, back of my neck & chest. its a little scary the first time, but it only lasts for about - min and then my migraine disappears with the side effects! no drowsiness or feeling groggy like others have complained of in my experience. i have found that it is more effective and works more quickly if i'm able to lay down in quiet when i ""feel"" it starting to work. my insurance covers it like a normal rx, but it only comes with  pills for the duration, but still worth every penny. i have tried all kinds of other migraine meds, with absolutely no success. zomig was my last hope without seeing a specialist (again) and trying combos of meds. over the past several months, it has cured almost all of my migraines (it doesn't help sinus headaches, but does help alcohol induced headaches-i get them even after one glass of wine). the mild side effects are completely tolerable considering i'm only sacrificing  hour, at most now, as opposed to - days. i can be a real person again!!!"

1,"benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  my breasts went from a full c cup to a full d cup!  i'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period. for the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  when my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about  days.  the second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps. i take the sunday start pills everyday in the afternoon."
1,"the drug levothyroxine  mics daily that i took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. i did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where i felt lithargic and brain dead.if i inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, i felt like i would notice my sluggishness a few days later. i had no side effects. i have since stopped taking the levothyroxine  mics daily. my provider explained to me since i was still feeling tired was to switch to the brand name synthroid  mics daily. i have noticed a big difference in my energy level and alertness. i can't believe i have gone this long ( years) feeling tired and out of sorts. i wish now i had been taking the brand name all along. no telling what things i may acomplished."
1,"this medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of mg.  this immediately helped with my insomnia.  it also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily. the major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case, but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.  in addition, there is a dry mouth effect that seems to resolve after a month or two. this was prescribed by my psychiatrist after trying several newer hypnotics.  the newer medications such as ambien and lunestra caused sleep disturbances, particularly altered dreams states.  in the case of the latter, it is prohibitively expensive."
1,"lowering of intraocular  pressure /keeping it under control a slight change in the coulour of the treated eye. my juvenile/pigmentary (open angle) glaucoma was diagnosed when i was  in  (my mother also had it). i was prescribed  kinds of eye drops which were effective for some time, but after a while, they couldn't control the intraocular pressure in my left eye, so i had to undergo a trabeculectomy in .
now i put drops only in my right eye (cosopt  times a day and xalatan once a day before i go to sleep). my eye pressure has been under control ever since."
1,"the symptoms and mal feelings of my prostate disapeared - but not completely (perhaps % of the problems disapeared).
sexual funktion and feelings of prostate improved remarkable.

(only % of improvement perhaps my personal problems were not solved with ibuprofen - and such problem put a lot of stress on prostata in some men) there were hardly any noticeable side effects.
the only thing i had to care about, was to take the medicine (ibuprofen) with food/ a meal because otherwise it would cause gastric problems.
and i took the second daily pill with dinner and left some ours before go to sleep.
perhaps ibuprofen causes a light drop in bloodsugar - but i�m not definitely sure about that. i had a bakterial prostatitis in the winter (likely from a combination of psychological and personal stress, bike riding in very cold conditions).
but also before the bacterial prostatitis i had a very sensitiv prostate and often sensual problems.

throughout treatment: insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, some dizziness at times, muscular twitching, fidgeting and spasming, weight loss due mostly to fidgeting all the time

1,"i have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. this medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. i started at mg, then shortly increased to mg, which left me feeling too drugged. it was only after + months of taking  mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms. initially the medication made me very drowsy. i began taking it at bedtime, which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  i think there may have been some weight gain, but i am not certain that it was specifically related to the lexapro. also, i did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm, but this side effect seemed to diminish within - months. i'm not sure waht you mean here- i started on the medication over  years ago at  mg a day. the dosage was increased to  mg after about  months.  the side effects were limited, and mostly not perticularly bothersome."

1,"the benefits of the treatment were clearing a fungal infection that plaqued me for a few months. i did not experince any treatment side effects. however, i did get pregnant while taking the medicine, but i did not have any complications. i had to take  pills everyday for six weeks to clear up the fungal infection. the treatment was not hard, but it was effective."
1,"the lumigan made my lashes grown longer and thicker. i didn't need to use as much mascara. i got itchy eyelids. the itching was fairly mild. i put a drop of lumigan on an upside down teacup. then i applied lumigan with a very fine artists type paintbrush. i would paint a thin line just above the lashes on top and just below the lashes on bottom. i would then use the remainder on my eyebrows. after about  weeks i noticed my lashes were longer and thicker. i washed the paintbrush carefully after each use and was careful to keep the line thin. after the first week, i began to use it every other night."
1,"once a day, sometimes  in a  hour period depending on the severe headache none i have had migraines since i was  years old. through jr high i would finish a bottle of aspirin in a week and a half. about every  or  days they were horrible with nausea , cold pack on my head, stay out of the light. about  years ago i developed cluster migraines. they last all day, nite for - months. i was introduced to imitex in . thank god!!!  they have been increasing in cost terribly. i went through sinus aerials, allergy tests, bio feed back. etc. nothing helped. i thought i would take my life when these clusters started. not only could i not function but i had to sleep sitting up. lying dowm made them worse.  i have no side effects.  but the imitrex is not working as well and i take aleve with it. treximet is not strong enough."
1,"i took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  i never noticed a great amount of pain, and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce, and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. i took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours i started to feel pain again.  it was effective in reliefing my pain. after taking the drug, i became sick to my stomach.  i threw up everything that i had consumed prior to the procedure.  this feeling stayed with me for several hours.  i initally thought i was sick, because i did not eat when i took the first dosage.  i then took another dose, but this time i made myself eat a little something, (i could not eat much at this point), but it mattered not...i got sick again.  i threw the rest of the presciption out. the prescription was given to me prior to having my tooth pulled.  i never filled the prescription because i really did not notice any pain.  after the procedure, i immediately went to have the prescription filled.  i took the medication while i was still numb from the novicane.  as the novicane wore off, and the two tablets i took wore off, i took the vicadine once again."
0,"i noticed hair regrowth in small amounts but did not know my genitals were shrinking.  a friend told me of his testicles shrinking on the drug and so i examined myself and realized that what once was, was no more. testiclular atrophy (permenent shrinkage). i actually have one testicle now smaller than the other.  i pray everyday that the pain will go away and that my buddies will come back but i dont think they will.  as for penile shrinkage, imagine a button on a sweater.  this drug is poison and im looking for a class action suit.  do not take this drug!!!!!!!! mg a day"
1,"lightning of dark pigments some dry skin especially under eye area applied once at night as directed.  applied sunscreen in morning of spf .  some dark pigmentation was lightened significantly but some places didn't lighten enough to go unnoticed.  acne was not helped, suprisingly, but the treatment did not make it worse either. overall skin appearance looked more uniform."
1,"general medical:  the treatment is for contraception.  i used it for weight control, skin problems and as a contraception, it was very effective for all of it except that when i left the medication i experienced severe hair loss which i was not warned about severe hair loss after terminating the pill, but no others whilst on it daily dose usually taken at night"
0,"none...i am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since i had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and i would be telling a bald faced lie if i said there were and but i will keep on typing so that i comply with the request for the fifty word minimun severe heart palpitations

i also suffered head aches and leg and foot cramps and this was from only three  mg doses which is very scarey in my opinion cipro was started while waiting for the results of a urine culture after it was found that i had blood in my urine and i had a high white blood cell count in the urine specimen. the thought was i had a severe infection so she opted to hit it hard with the most potent medicine available"
1,"when the drug actually kicked in, after about  days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.i got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. i was whistling!!!i stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. i realized i felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. i felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. never forget it, a fantastic feeling.truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.i have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own. quite severe night sweats and yawning,dry mouth,ejaculation disorder (not always a bad thing) not sure what you mean by this. was in relationship counceling and the psycologist suggested i was depressed as well as stressed. she suggested citalopram. saw my gp who prescribed it. never looked back. i did slide back in to depression a couple of years after first taking the drug but recognised the symptoms and got another script from my doctor with the same positive results."

1,"reduction of anxiety, better sleep quality, reduced gi symptoms (stress related) drowsiness in the morning. initially this drug was prescribed short term for a significant life crisis.  i did not use it much as such, i did not feel short term effects for daytime use.  i did, however, learn that taking  mg prior to bed would better the quality of my sleep, stop me from waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety and allow me to sleep longer. overall, this improvement in sleep quality allowed me to function better in the daytime thus allowing me to deal with the stressors on hand.  i have reduced the dose to . mg nightly with the same effects and less morning drowsiness.  i intend to continue to lower the dose until i am off it entirely.  that said, if the sleep disorder/anxiety returns, i will not hesitate to return to using the drug.  hope this helps someone."
1,"it works very well for anxiety. as for depression, it works but when i get into an episode of major depression, it seems to be somewhat ineffective at those times. dry mouth when one of my past psychiatrists tried to get me off of zoloft, i was okay for a while, but then after a month or so i developed considerable anxiety and depression and had to get back on zoloft for that to subside. in other words... zoloft is highly addictive when you have considerable anxiety/depression."
1,"ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  at times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. if it did not work i might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  these were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did. there did not seem to be any side effects of the ibuprofen. i almost always tried to make sure and eat something or drink milk when taking the medication as indicated to take with food.  i didn't experience any problems even when taking the maximum dosage suggested,  within a  hour period. i get severe headaches about every two or three months that can last for three to four days.  sometimes the most sever headaches seem to be what i call a combination headache, wherein i may be experiencing the routine headache associated with premenstrual cycle but may also be effected by sinus or seasonal weather/ pressure changes or tension headache.  it seems the hardest to treat is the combination of the premenstrual headache with the sinus headache.  i often took both ibuprofen and an over the counter sinus headache medication with some effectiveness.  there have been a few times when nothing took the headache away all day and i may even vomit just from the pain. some severe headaches were accompanied by sensitivity to light, noise or even smells."
1,".. .. i am , when i was in th grade i became ill with lyme disease. it was so severe that i was out of school for two years, and instead of going back to school and graduating hs at the age of  i got my ged and joined the army. i had a mos that did not require much thinking on your own. and because of that i was very successful. i made rank quick, was very respected, became the nco of the year twice, became a drill sgt. and because of all my military success i had no problem getting into a tier one college. out of all my deployments and undescribable situations ive been in, nothing compared with the stress of college. once identifying that i had a learning problem. i was prescribed vyvanse.
i am now going into my senior year and i am ranked in the top % of my class. vyvanse has given me focus and direction. with the good comes the bad. i have lost alot of muscle(i think it all went to my brain). i become aggressive and some times its hard to put into check before i lose control.
and i always have the desire to drink alcohol. for the most part i am able to have self control, but its not easy. i plan on continuing vyvanse through grad school. i would recommend this drug, you just need to have a good sense of self awareness, and keep your eye on the prize."
1,"treated the insomnia effectively. morning residual effects, drowsiness. tendency for dependency. take one as needed for insomnia. i took it every night. when it was gone, i discontinued use, as i felt that i was becoming dependent on this product."
1,provigil allows for better wakefulness in the daytime which in turn assists in better sleep. it also indirectly boosts mood by allowing some level of function during a chronic illness where things can easily spiral downward. there were no side affects until reached  mg / day.  this is above the normal dose but within dosing guidelines. it was a shot in the arm without any side affects. it is not a magic bullet but can provide some relief in a chronic situation.
1,elimination of pain in elbow .reduction in general muscle discomfort to rest of body after gym workout. none at all during the day or evening one mg tablet  times per day for  week. what i did find was that the pain in the elbow did return eventually and i would have to start re treating my self again

1,"after about an hour, headaches disappear. this drug works better for me than other drugs taken before the year , such as imitrex and zomig which i took for migraines. imitrex sped up my heart which scared me. zomig took  hours to work for me.
maxalt changed my life as i finally am able to function instead of wasting a whole day in a dark room in tears from the pain of migraine. i do not miss work days anymore. dry mouth and increased appetite which is preferable to the throbbing head pain and nausea of migraine.
sometimes i feel a bit sleepy but not so much that i cannot function or drive. maxalt is more gentle on my system than imitrex and zomig. on rare occasions, i have to take  maxalt in a  hour period. i do not feel addicted in any way. i always carry maxalt with me just in case. works best at first sign of migraine. in the 's and 's i just had to suffer from the pain and miss work days and cry in a dark room. i would take otc sleep aids just to escape the agony. found a dr who prescibed imitrex about  which helped, but then in the late 's my new doctor who also was a migraine sufferer suggested i try maxalt and it has been what i prefer. my headaches are fewer now, probably because of menopause which i am now using bio-identical hormones, biest and progesterone."
1,"i fractured of my ankle  years ago and about  years ago i developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  i tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  i was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that i have thought on a couple of occasions that i have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear. none noticed one mg tablet twice a day"
1,"restored me from total incapacitation to a full function. some drowsiness until i got used to it.  the side effects are totally insignificant compared to the benefits.  i usually take  mg at bedtime. the side effect of slight drowsiness is actually beneficial as i get to sleep faster and can function the next day with out the horrendous effects of dizziness, vertigo and nausea. i had my first episode of incapacitating dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting in about . i was a practicing orthopedic surgeon at the time. i was bed, flat on my back for about two weeks, when a fellow m.d. prescribed meclizine for me. within a few days i was back at work, fully functional.  since then i have ad about three significant episodes of acute dizzy, nausea and vertigo.  each as been less severe.  at the onset i take as many  mg meclizine tablets as i need to stop the process in its tracks. that can be up to  to  tabloids.   once the ephisode passes, usually in a fe days, i go back to my routine of one tablet at night. this drug has been a true godsend for me."
1,"i believe that there are multiple treatment benefits of taking tylenol for my headache. tylenol is safe, inexpensive, and does not require a physicians prescription. additionally, it is available almost everywhere and therefor is convenient. there were no treatment side effects from me taking tylenol for my headache. there are no deatails to report. my headache was gone within  minutes."
1,"reduced panic attacks, in combination with lexpro. particularly effective when taken an hour before panic inducing situations, such as flying. sleepiness; feeling ""out of it"" or not quite connected. it is not possible to work or drive when on the medication. must be taken at night or when you don't need to perform (such as on long flights). take xanax an hour before an anxiety inducing situation, or at night to reduce panic/anxiety attacks until the lexpro kicked in (about a month). after taking lexpro for several weeks, the xanax was no longer necessary."
1,reduced redness of complexion; reduction in overall inflammation of skin; reduced breakouts of acne. experienced mild lethargy and sensitivity to sunlight; some dizziness and quesiness when taken without a meal; found that taking with small meal at bedtime eliminated all these effects (as i was asleep). one  mg. sustained-release tablet taken once daily at any time of day with or without food.
1,"for many years, every spring i would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. after a few days, these symptoms went away. it really surprised me because i had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. some years my symptoms were so bad that i couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because i was sneezing so much. taking this medicine gave me my life back! i experienced no side effects at all from this nasal spray. this was great  because i had significant side effects from all the pills i had ever tried for my hay fever/nasal allergies (dry mouth and drowsiness). one or two squirts of the spray into each nostril once a day during allergy season."
0,"the medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression. unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. the tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. the tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication. i was prescribed wellbutrin, was on it for approximately  months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days."

1,"lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks. there was a decreased ability to have orgasms and a general numbing not quite stupor in which i existed. there was also a major decrese in appetite. this drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over lbs - i went from  to  lbs. the weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. the drug was effective in that i no longer felt depressed per se, but then i didn't feel much of anything. any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!"
1,"the hives were controlled afternoon tiredness and sleepiness i usually do not experience. i am to take this in the morning daily.  i am afraid to stop it because i fear the hives will return, but the sleepiness and lethargy in the afternoon is not pleasant.  i am considering cutting the tablet in two.  i have stopped the pill altogether for a few days to see what happens since i was told to ""take as needed""."
0,"there were no benefits as the sniffling, dripping, coughing continued even on the medicine. dry mouth. perscribed to help with the following symptoms: drippy nose, sinus congestion, post nasal drip, coughing, and sneezing. medicine was taken as directed with no real help. the only side effect was being a little dry."
1,"for years i was sleep deprived due to working conditions.  rarely would i enjoy the luxury of a full night sleep. typically i would take hours to get to sleep and had extreme difficulty remaining asleep. dreams were too realistic and often i would be more tired in the morning than upon retiring to bed. taking lunesta has allowed me not only to get to sleep but return to sleep.  if i wake in the middle of the night, for example to go to the bathroom, i am awake and not stumbling. the vivid dreams are gone and i have experienced no groggy or hungover symptoms that you sometimes hear of when taking sleep medication. 
it has truly changed my life and i am so grateful for my dr. for his prescription. it has been over a year and i have yet to see any side effects, other than increasing the dosage from -mg. one tablet, taken each night when i was already in bed and ready for sleep."

1,"it lowered my cholesteral considerably.  my total cholesteral was over  and my ldls were over , but after being on lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now  and my ldl is , so i am in good shape.  in addition, i have experienced no side effects whatsoever, so i am pleased.  the only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $. per month. i experienced no side effects whatsoever.  i have been on many medications over the last  years and normally experience at least some small side effect, but have not with lipitor.  i do get my liver function tested every few months, and so far it has been fine.  this is not a problem for me as the benefits outweigh any hassle of getting tested. i take  mg of lipitor daily and get a liver function test every three months.  so far, this has been fine, but i will need to be tested continually as long as i take lipitor.  i don't mind this, as the benefit of having a healthy cholesteral level is more important to me than any hassle of getting tested.  if at some point my liver function appears to be unhealthy, i'm guessing my doctor will have to reevaluate my situation, but for now, it's fine."
0,"when i was having a severe reaction normal antihistamines would not stop it so i needed to use panfacort which stopped problem within  minutes and the residual effects lasted on a a day or two. felt ill at times , lightheaded. took this when i had idiopathic urticaria and angiodema. at first it wsa prescribed inthe short term to try to ""dampen"" my immune system but it didnt help. i kept using then sporadically to help when a severe reaction was coming on or i needed to be problem free for the day. helped at the time but was not a long term solution"
0,"none increased difficulty breathing, strange taste. i have a prescription for albuterol for sports related asthma. i usually get the proair inhaler but the pharmacist insisted this was the same and gave it to me. the first day i had it, i went for a run. as usual, about  minutes in my chest begins to tighten and i cannot breath. i took a puff of the ventolin hfa inhaler. no effect. i stopped running. i took another puff. no effect. still cannot breath. i am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. i took several more puffs from the inhaler. no effect. i am now struggling to remain conscious, i am getting light headed and everything in my vision is pale. i begin to lay on my back, taking a few more puffs of the inhaler. no effect. my throat is now beginning to seize from the sheer force it takes to inhale tablespoon-sized breaths. i have a headache and hear a high pitched whining. i try several more puffs of my inhaler. no effect. i lay on the ground doing controlled breathing for several minutes. i tried a puff of ventolin hfa here and there with no effect, so i gave it up. i'm laying wondering if this is my last day on earth. about  minutes of pure agony later i catch my breath slightly. i now have an enormous headache and am dizzy. i get to my feet and start to walk toward my apartment (across the street). along the way, my chest seizes up a couple more times, and a couple more times i use the inhaler. no effect. i now have to wait another month before i can afford a proair inhaler before i can even exercise again. i think ventolin is for underdeveloped little kids who think they have asthma but actually don't. i have real asthma and this stuff almost killed me. the puff that comes out of it is nearly invisible, the puff from a proair inhaler is actually noticeable and...a 'puff'--about x more comes from the proair compared to the ventolin. even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness i have then, ventolin does nothing for. my girlfriend doesn't understand why i wheeze before and after i use the ventolin. well, it's because it doesn't work for me--in fact, it almost killed me. everything in this story is true, but i may have taken more puffs from the inhaler than i listed...any ?'s feel free to contact me: thecrookfromthebrook at yahoo.com. thank you and take care."
0,"my sinus infection felt better, although being unclogged, i constantly am spitting up mucus (especially after eating or drinking anything but water). metallic taste in mouth, constant back pain, slight nausea, constant tinnitus (nonstop ringing in ears), irritable (possibly due to lack of sleep due to the tinnitus and back pain), continuous stomach pain (strong after eating).  the ringing in my ears and back pain(thoracic region) is driving me crazy, but i have to stick it out so that if treated again with this antibiotic in the future, it will be successful.  counting down the days!!!  i just keep looking at pictures of the beach. twice a day ,  days"
1,"i have rhinitis almost all year long. usually it gets worse in the cold season. i have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don�t work for me at all. this nasal spray clears the congestion in  minutes, doesn't last for the whole night, but the pretty pleasant smell make me feel good. as any other drugs that suppress the immune system, i believe the fluticasone propionate nasal spray is also make people more susceptible to infections than health individuals. but i guess if the congestion is so bad that one cannot get a quality sleep, it does more harm than the side effect of the nasal spray. i started using it right before last christmas, hoping to get better before the holiday. it cleared the congestion for the a few hour after the first time i used it. i keep using it twice a day. for about five days and my nose became much less stuffy and less runny. i didn't completely treat my rhinitis, but i could sleep better. i am happy with the result."
1,"definitely made me fall asleep. very fast acting, about  minutes after taking it, i feel groggy. memory loss. if you don't go to sleep immediately after feeling groggy, you will continue on with your life unbeknownest to you! i called people i never call, ate lots of food, watched movies, and had conversations, all of which i haven't the slightest recollection of. 
it is my belief that the long term memory effects must parallel the short term. 
also i experienced vivid nightmares and hallucinations.
habit forming despite denial of drug company. recreational drug. not worth the side effects for the benefit. try something natural, tylenol pm, or any other sleep aid but this one!"
1,"all but stopped my hair loss.  after a couple of months i noticed that i had virtually no hair in my hands after washing it as opposed to - hairs before... also no more hair on my pillow, whereas before is was quite obvious it was falling out. visually there is no more loss.  i don't know if it is growing back, but as long as it stays i'm cool... i havent had any side effects that people have claimed, and erectile function is normal. also, my sex drive was relatively low before, so i dont think that has changed. one a day.... rarely miss a day...  like some people, i dont like taking a pill everyday, but...  but  dollars a day to keep your hair... definitely worth it!"
1,"cost savings and more control versus combo of levoxyl and cytomel.  without insurance, i got my doctor to write a year's worth rx and ordered in from canada. none with armour.  cytomel got out of hand and i lost too much weight and my hair started to fall out.  armour is more naturally balanced. ongoing medication, helps get circulating t into my system, boosts metabolism and energy, makes me fee normal."
0,"hardly any except i felt so physically tired that i couldn't even feel depressed. i was so exhausted that i could hardly get out of bed and get to work. at work, i just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. as soon as i got home around pm, i had to go to bed. it was ridiculous. i just started treatment for severe depression. i sleep okay, but have nightmares all night, which is why my doctor recommended remeron. i am going to ask for a change in this because even though it has only been a few days, i am barely functional."

1,"when you are in a mild depression or dystimia the worst thing is that you are unable to think or concentrate, you feel sleep and tired all the day. it's like 
having a permament cloud in your mind. i think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now i have a sharper mind, i feel more energetic and i can concentrate properly. the most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. i take deprax to induce sleep but even with it i woke up very early. you can get used to some side effects like dry mouth, vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor, although not serious, is very noticeable. i experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now. the treatment consists of cymbalta mg and deprax  mg, but it has been changed many times. the most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. i tried with loramet and diazepam but their effect last too much, it's impossible to concentrate. deprax mg is the best i've taken to sleep. now i'm taking just mg and i don't fall sleep so quick but it's fine, i have enough rest."
1,"i can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  my condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  with prevacid, i eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  i have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  with religious use of prevacid, this rarely occurs.  i can eat a larger variety of foods. it has made a positive difference in my quality of life. i have not experienced negative physical side effects that i am aware of.  this drug does not aid with digestion of food.  i still have nausea and vomitting but, not because the drug doesn't work.  my doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating. i have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  i have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  with prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) i can eat and drink with less nausea.  without it, my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  it has made a tremendous positive difference.  i do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  it is not a treatment for the paresis.  reglan is the only fda approved prescription drug for my condition that i am aware of.  i cannot use it without horrible side effects."
1,"got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.   there would be times, perhaps one out of three, where i would  consider taking two of the  mg sumatriptans fatigue- more pronounced when i first started taking this drug i take sumatriptan at the onset of a migraine.   it works best if i am just beginning to notice the pain over my eye."
0,"pain is now under control to some degree.  still have pain throughout body and down legs.  before the medication i would not be able to get out of bed for sometimes days.  even when i could get out of bed i would not be able to sit up or walk for more than  minutes before i had to lay down.  now i am able to be up all day, walk and sit up for more than - hours at a time. it sometimes makes me feel ""high"", vision problems, coordination problems. switch from percocet to lortab every  months."
1,"pentasa seems to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug, minimizing pain in my intestines/colon.  i have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and i attribute it primarily to the pentasa. i don't feel as though i have any discernible side-effects with pentasa, but when paired with purinethol i do have side effects such as extreme fatigue and headaches, leading me to believe the problem lies with the purinethol. i do have intermittent constipation, which could be attributable to a number of factors in my life, but is also a side-effect of pentasa. i also have mild headaches, muscle pain, and anxiety which are listed as possible side-effects with pentasa, but to the best of my knowledge these symptoms were occuring prior to my starting pentasa.  perhaps the pentasa exacerbates the problems, i don't know.  i know that i do worry about kidney problems, which is one of the more serious side-effects of this medicine. twelve years ago i became ill with what was diagnosed two years later (!) as crohn's disease.  i have used a variety of medications, ranging from more serious drugs (prednisone, remicade)to less ""harmful"" drugs (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, asacol, etc.). i have been on the pentasa for about  years, during which time i was using purinethol for several years.  a year or so ago i weaned myself off of the purinethol and remained on the highest dose of pentasa for my weight, and i am doing well (knock on wood).  i have constipation issues as opposed to my previous diarrhea problems, which may be attributable to the pentasa, and is manageable through diet and over-the-counter aids."
1,"i am now wide awake--for the first time in years!!!  my body aches have lessened greatly.  i am alert.  i can keep up with the housework.  i have a better memory, concentration, and overall mood.  i have regained my creativity.  my appetite/desire to overeat has decreased, though i still have an appetite.  i just eat like a normal person, now.  i don't suffer from emotional or boredom eating.  i am steadily losing weight-- lbs. so far.  i also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that i couldn't do before.  i feel like someone handed me my life back! it took time to figure out when to take the medicine.  from everything i've read, i am supposed to take it in the morning.  but, that made me wide awake, even at night, and it interfered with my meal schedule.  so, now i take it around  p.m.  i still sleep well, something new for me, and can easily wake up, feeling alert throughout the day.  i've never felt this way before.  it's awesome! synthroid-- mcg. + liothyronine-- mcg., both daily, around  p.m.

magnesium-- mg. + vitamin d (alternating between  mg. and  mg.), daily   (my body's not absorbing the vit. d very well--will get rechecked in a week.)

1,"got rid of my raging epidimytis and prostatitis. the pain started to subside within - days. within the first week almost all symptoms were gone. minor symptoms persisted until the - day. by the th day all symptoms were gone. but - the side effects were awful. let it be known that i have been treated once before with ciprofloxacin, where i experienced no side effects. this time was a little different...

- muscle pains in thighs, chest, and traps. 
- tightness of chest 
- joint pains - specifically on the outsides of my knees. some pain in wrists, elbows, and upper back.
- semi severe pain in lymph nodes of neck w/ little to no swelling.
- complete anxiety that i had lympoma; both swollen lymph nodes and anxiety are side effects of cipro
- general anxiety
- made me poo a lot. (kinda funny in retrospect)
- low sex drive
- pain in lower rib cage, a little higher than the kidneys. could not identify weather muscular or otherwise.
- pain in diaphragm
- pain in neck
- pain in upper jaw (only experienced this once for about an hour)
- pain in jaw would often radiate to pain in temples
- ringing in ears/dulled hearing (this would last for about  minutes at a time)
- very slight muscle twitching (only sometimes)
- i would get ""pins and needles"" very easily
- i was colder than normal for the entire two weeks
- i was very irritable - but i can't decide if my short temper was a side effect of the drug, or if it was caused by the drag of having so many side effects.

other than the frequent bowel movements, i had no stomach or nausea problems. my bowel movements were very normal, and stomach aches were never an issue. 

all of the side effects became persistently worse, starting off as very minor side effects and progressing to a moderate stage. some of the side effects (particularly the lymph node pain) didn't start until the second week.  days of this crazy drug solved my infection, but the side effects were killer. ask your doctor about alternatives before starting ciprofloxacin."
0,"immediately took the pain from the strep away. terrible taste in mouth,  and a half hours of constant dry-heaving, painful and sudden headaches, body aches. the side effects were so terrible, never felt so badly in my entire life. wouldnt recommend for anyone unless they have a strong stomach"
1,"i sufffered from dibilatating panic attacks, but they only lasted - minutes max. i was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. it got to where i had an attack at least every other day. the citalopram kicked in in about  weeks and i've had only  episode since, granted i've only been on it for  months but it has worked wonders for me. none that i have noticed.  mgs. once a day."
0,"less depressed, i could consintrate on daily life better. i was happier, less anxious, stopped worrying so much. i felt manic at times, surreal. i was thirsty a lot, and forgot to eat. i was suppose to take mg daily for treatment of depression, it helped my depression but i often felt manic and 'not myself'"
0,"none, i felt worse. this is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact i felt much much worse. unfortunately, i didn't review the contraindications. i got a rash on the back of my neck that lasted for  year even though i only took prozac for  months. also, i couldn't sleep as a result of taking prozac. it seemed like after i stopped taking it i still had it in my body because i couldn't get rid of the rash on my neck and it was very annoying. thhis is the first time that anything like this has ever happened to me. i took it once a day for pms"
1,to lessen the severity of an onset or outbreak of genital herpes. i had no noticable side effects to taking the medication. i started taking the medication at the first signs of an outbreak (usually a brief sharp pain at the site). the medication seemed to shorten the actual outbreak time and lessened the pain and discomfort.
0,less depression.  had more energy to do things.  able to get involved in activities that i would otherwise not engage in. had daytime drowsiness.  constipation.  had to take a stool softner on a daily basis.  lowered my blood pressure a little.  slowed my heartbeat a little bit. increased appetite.  i gained twenty pounds in a little over two years.  it slowed my metabolism.  i could eat one low calorie meal in a day and not lose one pound. i would see a psychiatrist once a month.  the doctor would ask me how i was feeling and would change the dosage if neccesary.
1,i feel that the citalopram helps keep me calm. i no longer have mood swings as often. no longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. no longer want to leave work because of depressed moods. first  days wicked nasea. i do sweat more than usual. trouble sleeping at times. i started taking mg pills for a few months. i noticed that it would feel as though it was wearing off by pm or so. my doctor prescribed me up to mg for a week and then to mg for the rest of the month. things seem better than on the mg. however i still get depressed at times and nothing seems to ever go right. perhaps therapy will help which my doctor mentioned. going to continue on the mg for a few more months and see if it helps if not i will make another apt at the doctor and see what she thinks weather we want to try and up the dose or try something different.
1,"highly motivated vs my previous state of, ""why do i get up in the morning""? nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person. harder to climax, although i didn't necessarily lose interest in sex drive. went off of it once i felt better- i have been off of it for about  months and feel good still."
1,"wow. i find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist. mild constipation but relieved with fiber rich diet and liquids, strange taste and some deja vu/strange mental sensations. cocaine antagonist (positive) i took this drug with the intentions of quitting smoking. i also however, discovered on accident that this drug just about completely blocked the euphoric effects of cocaine and then subsequently blocked the ""crash"". all that would be experienced was a racy heart and undesirable ""too much caffeine"" feeling with nausea. this drug has a seriously powerful effect on the euphoric of stimulants and needs to immediately be put into treatment plans for stimulant abuse. for its indications, nicotine, it definately does its job here too my cravings for nicotine are pretty much extinguished though there still seems to be slight reward in an occasional cigarette, just goes to show how much i feel this drug stabilized my adhd downsides such as deficient dopamine function in my brain. it worked better than bupropion. i understand chantix has some issues with side effects but hopefully they will work those kinks out because this really looks to be a miracle drug."
1,"stopped sneezing runny nose and other allergic symptoms.effecive for common cold and fever if given in the begning of the disease.can be taken till the sputum changes the color to yellow.can be taken till transparent sputum or discharge from nose.result is very quick (within some hours after taking the tablet) my doctor toldme not to drive a car or swim while taking the tablet asit may have some sedative effect.when i took the tablet,i felt a sort of tiredness.and surely i slept well.these were the  side effects which i felt and when i stopped the tablet the symptoms disappeared. i was a person with sinusitis due to allergy.if i happen to take dusty book or something i used to sneeze a lot then get fever and eventually nasalblockage.i used totake antibiotics every now and then.later doctor toldme to take cetirizine once or twice a day when the symtoms start.i took the medicine and the symtoms disappeared within some hours.now i am no more taking antibiotics as my allegy doesnt lead to sinusitis or fever."
1,"it was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  it seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  it was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  there were no side effects of note.  the cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  all in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues. none apply thin layer twice per day.   non oily, cream based formula."
1,"climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. it also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). the side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch. the only side effect from the climara is mild itching after removing the patch. another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone i have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my ibs - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. so i take the progesterone only  days/month now and the side effects are minimal. after being miserable with frequent (+ times/day, - times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, i went on hormone replacement therapy. estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so i went on the patch, which i have to change only once a week. the recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but i found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my ibs symptoms. to lessen that effect, i went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only  days/month. this is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but i feel much better overall because my ibs symptoms are much less severe and less frequent."
1,"i feel alot less pain taking the flexeril (only at night) and the lyrica. i feel sleepy and have days where in have trouble concentrating. for fibromyalgia, in the morning i take half of a multi-vitamin and mg of lyrica.  days out of  days, i excercise for  to  minutes on a tredmill. in the evening, i take half a multi-vitamin, mg of lyrica, and mg of flexeril"
1,"seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. i have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past  years. i play with the dosage and make my own changes ( mgs at a time) based on how i'm doing, so i've taken between  and  mgs at any given time. the effects i attribute to the seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression. dry mouth, vivid dreams (i remember most of my dreams from the past  years), extreme lethargy (the wellbutron helps counteract that) i currently take  mgs at night before bed along with  mgs of lamictal and wellbutron. no therapy anymore."
1,"reduced acid production to normal levels. at prescribed level of  mg/day i suffered fatigue and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. at half this dose i was fine. but, needed dosage levels are different for different people. the secret of taking proton pump inhibitors and h receptor inhibitors lies in finding the right dosage and the right time of day to take it. zoton fast tabs are tablets which dissolve on the tongue and can be broken to alter the dosage. i found that half my prescribed dosage of  mgs/day was enough for me and so break the tablet in two."
1,"my urination problems (urgency , frequency , etc ) practically disappeared and i no longer had get off my bed to urinate several times during the night there were none i took one pill a day every evening with a glass of water after dinner .the treatment was supervised by a proctologist"
1,"initially i was prescribed it to knock me the hell out after  days of beautifully manic insomnia. then after the mixed episode ended they spiked the dose over the course of a few months to , where it sits. 

the effects, compared to when i was in the episode i'm very stable. occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
as for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where i'm almost dependent on it to sleep. considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase i would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect. i'm very slow to get going in the morning. i often hit my snooze alarm - times (only  minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm  hours before i have to be anywhere.

the worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where i can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. i've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until i go unconscious and stop caring.

also, something which i'm not sure if i can blame the seroquel for; i sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. not like heart-chest pain (from what i'd imagine it's like), but a different pain. hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly. dec - zoloft, sparked a  week long mixed phase with psychotic features.  days into it i was prescribed  mg seroquel.

jan -april , increasing doses of seroquel, up to . also wellbutrin, starting at  and eventually reaching . the wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than i was before, and i stopped taking it. since then it's been the seroquel, and i've been mostly stable since."
1,"after a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. it was a few cm big. by the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. i'm cyst free since then. it stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. but the worst side effect for me was i got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. not only that, i noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. it took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. and another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. i gained about kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face. the treatment was easy enough. the gynaecologist prescribed danazol for the ovarian cyst i had and it was very effective. the cyst was gone and didn't come back too."
1,"i'm only four days in, but i already feel more like myself than i have in a year and a half.  the effects were almost immediate.  i've taken more responsibility, had more energy, and been more outgoing already. nausea, restless leg syndrome, dry mouth, teeth clenching, bouts of fatigue, mania (temporary...first night only), insomnia, acne, inability to edit myself in some social situations with continue chemical therapy using celexa, i look forward to massive improvement in my overall mood and personality."
1,the medicine has stopped her wetting both day and night and worked within a week of her taking it. she is over the moon and so am i! my daughter complains of a pain in her bladder area and some constipation and her face looks a little flushed. i am considering lowering the dose to x .ml per day she has had  years of bladder infections and has had various scans and tests. i think that she has never been able to read the signals from her bladder properly due to all the infections. this medicine which was prescribed by the dr on a trial basis seems to be working well. we will try to wean her off it slowly after a little while
0,honestly i have felt no change in my symptoms. if anything it feels as if they are getting worse. i constantly am getting sever headaches and my symptoms have not alleviated. i have not experienced any type of symptoms. i am also extremly tense to where the tendons in my neck do no sit flat. for me i didnt have any side effects. x a day with food & milk
1,when i began taking tramadol i had severe arthritis pain and could not sleep more than  hours a night. tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. i had to take up to  tylenol or  ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain. there was mild drowsiness in the beginning or with taking the full allotted doses but no other adverse side effects. i take - trmadol daily for my arthritis pain. always  before bed and one upon waking if i begibn to feel pain during the day i may take another. my blood levels are monitored every  months to make sure there is no liver damage from this and/or the ibuprofen i take.
0,"absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  through research i learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  no idea why my doctor precribed penicillin.  would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment. no side effects at all, just took an antibiotic i did not need and do not see any health benefit in that at all doctor diagnosed me with viral bronchitis after and xray.  he then prescribed penicillin to treat it.  worthless treatment, since penicillin is totally ineffective to fight a virus."
1,"the trimethobenzamide significantly reduced nausea and brought it down to a perceptible but comfortable level. none. after being diagnosed with temporary vertigo, i was given prescriptions for this plus meclizine for dizziness. the two combined brought the vertigo completely under control. there were no side effects. i took the medication as originally prescribed for two days and then, at my doctor's suggestion, reduced the amount to as-needed. the trimethobenzamide made it possible to eat normally, with no uncomfortable feelings of nausea."
1,"a feeling of caring but not really caring. i feel like i become emotionally involved to deeply and this drug has kept me on the ""surface"" for lack of a better term. dry mouth and nausea for first  days. started taking at night only and didn't notice if it was making me tired, switched to day and seems to make me feel as if i need a nap but i am studying biology right now. might switch to nights again mg once a day for  weeks, then mg"
1,"if drug is taken at very first sign/symptom of cold sore, the drug will elliminate it within that day. if the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). this medication is not a cure for cold sores. i have not noticed any side effects and have been taking this drug for a couple of years. it is important to note, there is no cure for cold sores (herpes). i don't know how the drug works but it seems if i am run down over the course of several weeks i may have to take the drug several times to keep a cold sore from surfacing. when you first feel a cold sore coming on take  pills with water, wait  to  hrs and then take another  pills. i have heard of people taking a daily maintenace dose that should ensure you never see a break out of blisters appearing, however, if not on a drug program, this would be very expensive, and depending on how many times you tend to break out, probably not necessary."
0,"had to take a thyroid replacement, so it did that, but not as well as i would have expected. was very tired, had memory problems, weight gain.  had trouble moving around, joint pain. synthroid was prescribed as thyroid replacment hormone after total thyroidectomy due to nodules, etc from graves disease.  was determined that  mcg was the correct dose.  however after  years of taking synthroid and endocrinologist unwilling to try alternative medication, i found another doctor who did some additional testing.  she found that i was low in free t & t and the prescribed armour thyroid.  i feel much better on this thyroid replacement than i did using synthroid."
0,"no improvement at all in symptoms. over the past few months i have developed borderline hypertension, increased bruising, my hair texture and skin continue to worsen. at  i was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and this was corrected through medication (thyroid disorders are prevalent in my mother's family).  i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (tsh .) this past december and evidence of an auto immune disorder.  since, i have been on mcg daily, my tsh tests normal but  there has been no improvements in symptoms."
1,"daily application, cured the fungal infection despite side effects.  over the counter use of lotrimin ag did no work, and prescription alternaitve medication using miconizole nitrate (same as in monistay) cost upwards of $ / tube, as my insurance did not cover much of it. caused localized eczema that had to be treated with hydrocortisone cream, which is risky as that can cause damage to the skin under the diaper area. had to apply with each diaper change, along with a otc diaper cream or applied with aquaphor, and twice a day had to add the otc hydrocortisone cream."
1,"this medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  the first time that i took the medication the hives were already  days old, therefore, it took about  days for them to clear up. now, if i ever feel the itch or see the blotchiness i can take one dose of this medicine and the hives do not progress and they are clear within one day. there were no side effects noticed with this medication. take  tablets once per day."
0,"reduced symptoms of acid reflux diarrhea the insurance company no longer covered protonix, but substituted omeprazole. it is not as effective at reducing episodes of acid reflux as protonix, and the dose had to be doubled to approach the same level of efficacy."
1,"i believe that i suffered from depression my whole life.  i feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if i had some treatment for my feelings.  my whole family would agree that i am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life. i am not sure if it is only the drug but i have almost no sexual feelings. could just be my age...who knows. i'm not sure what you mean by ""treatment details"" but i saw a psycotherapist for several months and she prescribed the paxil and ok'd the paroxetine.  i share my treatment with anyone because i think that depression is not the best descriptive word for what was troubeling me.  thanks for your work!"
1,"solodyn virtually eliminated any acne i had, both on my face and body.  it took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication. i didn't experience any side effects until about four weeks into treatment, at which time i began breaking out in very mild hives.  they were so mild, in fact, that i originally thought they may have been caused by a lotion or cosmetic that had gotten on my skin, or maybe by something i had eaten.  the hives would come and go throughout the day, appearing very sparsely on my face, neck, and/or hands.  a few days passed, and i realized that they must have been caused by the drug, so i stopped taking it and the hives went away after a day or so.  i want to stress that these hives were very mild.  i have had allergic reactions to drugs in the past (which may have made be more susceptible this time) and every previous experience i've had with drug-related hives has been much, much worse and possibly life-threatening if not treated.  perhaps that would have been the case with these as well if i had continued taking the drug, but they didn't seem to be particularly alarming, just mildly annoying. i took one pill every morning at the same time each day."
0,"i initially switched over from axert since my insurance covers more of the imitrex prescription.  imitrex just isn't right for me.  i experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  on top of that the packaging is just horrible!  it comes  to a package.  the packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  it's about  / by  / inches, folded.  i  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so i ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  definitely going back to axert! flushing, tingling, prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and pounding heartbeat. take  tablet by mouth. max  tabs per  hours."
1,"i took alprazolam for  months for extreme anxiety/depression. it did work considerably in the beginning, however i would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. i would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. it did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. in retrospect, i shouldn't have taken the medication because i was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because i have an addictive personality. i discussed this with my dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. i later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. also, i've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. i think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. i don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. if you have an addictive personality like myself, i think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. but exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, i think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. i suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. i only say this because i know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are very unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx.  hours. i will also say gladly, that i have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. the bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. best of luck. lethargy, loss of appetite. i was started at .mg, the second strength of dosage,  times daily. i became afraid of it because i was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, i was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression."
1,"treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about  hours, instead of the intended .  then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above. increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache, nervousness, heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the loss of appetite. i had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days, before i felt comfortable in taking it again.  now i take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies. treatment details included, at first, a dosage first thing every morning, around am. during moderate allergy season, this lasted me until the following morning, but as soon as i got up at , symptoms came on full strength.  the allegra did not take effect for an hour and a half.  so i started waking up at  to take it then, so that as i prepared for work i was able to do so without runny eyes, nose, etc.  but during the heavy allergy season (dogwood), i would take one at am and one at pm.  within two weeks the side effects had me back to my regular dosage."

1,"it cleared up my nasal allergies, my stuffy nose, post nasal drip and as an added benefit it also helped prevent getting hoarse. there were no side effects, but i was careful to only use it when needed and not to use it for more than  month at a time. i would use as directed for the first few weeks, then cut the dose in half for maintenance.  it take about a day and a half to start working and about  days to work fully."

1,"a total of  pounds lost in one month. although i reached my goal weight, the drug made me very restless, anxious, moody.  i also experienced headaches, and falling asleep was not easy while on this drug.  dizziness, light headed. take one mg pill in the morning and one after lunch to curb appetite.  i fond myself able to stay more active and run longer at the gym. it's a toss up if the results were worth the side effects.  it's obvious that a drug this strong that makes you want to run a marathon and not eat can't be good for you!"
1,"skin became smoother, fewer breakouts dry skin was easily remedied with moisturizer.  my skin is aggravated by sunscreens and that concerns me, but using clinique moisturizer has assisted with the dryness and i have not experienced any irritation.   for sun protection,  i just put on a hat when i am exposed to the sun and thus far i have had to problems with sun irritation. i use the retin a every night as needed if there is a breakout for about  weeks."
1,"although this is not available in generic, i am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment.

it does make my mouth pretty dry, especially first thing in the morning. i also have dry eyes i believe as a result of taking trazodone and it makes it difficult to wear contacts because of the dryness."
1,"i had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. i was prescribed ambien mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. on the nights i didn't take the medicine, i woke up all through the night. with the medicine, i slept well and soundly. the only side effect i recall, which was very minor, was a sluggish feeling, only if i didn't sleep for a minimum of  hours. this was only on one occassion. post surgery to my right knee i was in considerable pain, and suffered insomnia because of it. ambien mg was prescribed as needed at bedtime. i took it nightly for the first  nights post surgery. on the th night, i didn't take it, and woke up all through the night. all in all i took the ambien a total of  out of the first  days following the surgery. it helped me to sleep very soundly and the pain didn't interupt my sleep. i had no ill effects from it at all. i still have the remaining  tablets that were prescribed one year ago."

around the same tine i have been plagued with repeated episodes of itching, strange rashes all over my body and my hands are full of unsightly cracks,sores and redness. now the episodes are getting closer and closer and worse each time. topical and internal steroid meds and antibiotics to avert infection, all help just until the next outbreak which after the last bout was about a week or so."
0,"i experienced a weight loss of approximately  kg in  month. the effects tapered off in the second month with the total weight loss to be estimated at  kg. subsequently i felt less urge to snack i experienced mood swings, short temper, thirst. i was constantly thirsty and had mild tension headaches too. often, i will flare up for no good reason but the outbursts went away swiftly. i also observed that i am quite bloated after food. i took the medication for  months,  times a week to prevent addiction. the treatment is optional with mediaxal another weight loss drug which i opted out. i noticed an obvious decrease in appetite during the first  weeks with a gradual return of my appetite. i went back for a review every  weeks where my blood pressure and weight was recorded. the medicine was supplemented with a low calorie diet and exercise."
0,"there was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  i believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  the side effects were so severe i was afraid to drive the car.  my memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and i still felt pain. my thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence i sounded as if i was on drugs.  the side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  i could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  this medication was meant for diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  i feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  as all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  i would not recommend anyone take it. irrational thinking, disrupted thought process, slow reactions while operating a vehicle prescribe to me by my do as the newest drug for fibromyalgia she did not know how the drug worked but wanted to me to try it to see if it reduced my muscle pain.  i took myself off the drug because the side effects were to severe and they did not lesson over time."
0,"patient experienced no treatment benefits. the major side effect was persistent thoughts of suicide - always by hanging. these thoughts developed after about three weeks of treatment and became more persistent as time went on. patient stopped taking the medication after two months subsequently informing attending physician, who initially did not believe that medication could provoke that side effect in someone  years of age. treatment details are as described above."

0,"i was not able to use the cream long enough because of the side effects. the cream itched and burned severely to the point of being nearly intolerable for the first week.  the burning subsided in the second week, but not to the point of being usable on a daily basis. application of cream nightly  minutes after washing.  product information advised waiting, but it still burned and itched when applying it after waiting.  it had no real visible effect during the time i used it.  i gave it a  instead of  because i felt a very subjective glimmer of potential improvement at the end of the period, but not enough to overcome the pain."
1,increased synaptic dopamine levels. this gave me an amazing sense of wellbeing and clarity. positive side effects: see above i'm a healthy  year old with no medical conditions. i use selegiline (l-deprenyl) purely to optimise my health and fortunately use a loop hole to import the drug into the country which does not have restriction importation for personal use
0,"the benifits of the treatment were that it stopped the pain. i could sleep at night. i could eat food that i could not eat before. because i was not in consent pain i could get on with my life there were not any treatment side affects except that you had to take two tablets twice a day for the rest of your life. this was not a cure. i then found out that ther was an austrailan  docter who found that in some cases ulcers were only a bacteria and a simple test would find that out and if that was the case a short couse of antibotics and an anti acid for the same period of time whislt you were talikg the course of antibotics, would get rid of the problem, which in my case it did. now i dont have to take drugs every day! tablet twice a day"
1,"this cream was very beneficial for the treatment of acne and some blemishes.  i had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  this cream began to work within several days.  i could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because i applied the cream as soon as i saw a new one forming, many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards. i had no side effects because i was applying the cream correctly; only before bedtime and washed them off in the morning.  however i heard of some other person whp took the same cream but was not aware of those instruction and instead applied it in the morning and  had her face exposed during the day.  the cream worked somewhat for her but the spots where she applied them stayed irritated and would turn red when the wind blew in her face.  this condition remained for several years afterwards for her.  this cream cannot be exposed to the sun! otherwise it works beautifully. the treatment was very simple.  at night (and only at night!) i cleaned my face with a mild cleanser or atleast with water and did not apply any other medication before hand.  afterwards i simply dabbed a very small, thin layer of the cream over the pimple and allowed the cream to dry and then went to sleep.  in the morning i made sure to wash off the cream before going outside.  for very sensitive skin the area may turn red but this is temporary and simply means that instead of applying each day one must use it every other day."

1,"small pill easy to take.  easy to pack in a travel pack in an alternate pill case without taking the entire bottle. i did not experience any side effects that i am aware of.  of course, i am concered over having high blood pressure which has to be directly related to work-related stress. apparently, this will be long-term treatment.  my doctor and i had several conversations over high blood pressure.  though i have increased my exercise routines, there is not a positive impact on my blood pressure.  after  month on norvasc, my blood pressure was within the normal range."
1,"within a couple of weeks, intrusive thoughts of suicide abated.  over the next few weeks mood lifted some.  at the time i started i was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  and i'm against anti-depressants as st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. mood disorders. does have light stimulant effect which is great for the extreme fatige of depression but/and any activating chemical can also increase hostile, angry feelings so tweek the dose for you so you don't get over reactive with others. take  mg wellbutrin xr daily in morning, eat healthy whole foods, exercise-outdoors as much as possible, prayer; meditation, yoga, get rest, restructure negative beliefs into positive beliefs-cognitive & spiritual approaches"
1,"wellbutrin and prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. there really wasn't anything more to it, but i gather i have to write  words, so here they are. none. i'm not sure i understand the question. this was pretty simple - i had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. the drugs prevented that without side effects."
1,"remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. i had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for  years and tried to treat it with otc drugs. it appeared one night, not slowly over time. i tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested remeron. it took a few weeks to take effect but it has been % successful for about  years now. i used to take up to  mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to  mg. over the years. if i miss one dose i know it. falling asleep is no problem. my problem is staying asleep for more than  or  hours night after night after night. . . not fun. no side effects. no hangover. no morning drowsiness. take about / hour before bedtime."
1,a considerable decline in the occurrence of new spots accompanied treatment. the acne has been practically eliminated if a good cleansing routine is maintained. red marks have faded. blackheads have cleared up. the overall result is clearer and smoother skin. occasional mild skin irritation particularly in the beginning of treatment. applied a small amount to the face once daily in the afternoon. applied sunscreen during the day to compensated for the increase in photosensitivity
1,"eventual acne reduction. dry skin and eyes, flaking skin and bloody noses. however, the most pertinent side effect was depression. after struggling with acne throughout my teens, i was put on accutane with promises of a 'miracle drug.' my acne eventually cleared, but severe drug-induced 'flare-ups' of more acne were common, as well as feelings of depression."

1,"my acne cleared up within a few months, and now it is gone. you cannot wax your eyebrows! it thins your skin, so you can't wax. i used the gel once at night. i also took an antibiotic and yazmin. i believe i will continue to use the differin even after i stop the antibiotic, just for it's benifits."
0,"after about a week, i started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  over the -week treatment period, there was about a  percent reduction in the size of the cysts. there was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

another benefit was that i did not get upper gi pain & bleeding with this med, whereas nsaids had been causing black stools due to gi irritation & bleeding. within about  minutes of taking each dose of sulindac, i experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  the pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  duration lasted  -  hours each time.  this side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period. due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, i am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  the cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  the cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

in past i had used nsaids to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to nsaid-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  his recommendation was that i try a drug in the pro-nsaid class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

in retrospect, i think that for me, the sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the sulindac.  due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  my response to the sulindac was less robust than i had hoped for -- much less improvement than i had experienced previously with nsaids -- and it also took a long time ( weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past i would achieve in  days with otc nsaids."

1,"definitely noticed right away that i had more energy, better concentration and motivation, and could actually focus for the first time in years. by taking this med, it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: i started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. now the med simply acts as a support for me, but i am ready to start tapering down my dose!!! had trouble losing too much weight at first. but that levels off after a while. had problems sleeping when the dose was increased too quickly. i have to make sure i take the full amount for the day at least before  noon or i will have trouble sleeping that night. sometimes i get shaky/nervous, dry mouth, feel dehydrated. take  pills about an hour before i wake up in the morning. then i take the third pill between  am- noon."

1,"improved ability to focus and concentrate. memory retention better. improved energy. mainly helped relieve brain fog that is common with chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia. especially noticeable while working. able to function better and work longer, more like my old self. weight loss, decreased appetite. if take too late in the day, may affect ability to sleep. take  pill in the morning to treat add-like symptoms that started after a car accident. took several years to get chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia diagnosis and quite awhile after that before this medicine was prescribed. tried most of the standard add medications to help with brain fog but bad side effects, worked for awhile then stopped, or no effect. many doctors not comfortable perscribing this medication for add or add-like symptoms since it's a weight-loss medicine. i usually only take this medication during the work week and give my body a break on teh weekends."
1,"it was fairly successful for the acne.  i found it especially good at spot treatment if i felt a cystic type coming up. it did dry my skin out and there was peeling in some places, like the sides of my nose.  i had to be very careful about not getting it any where around my lips, because if i did i would quickly get a fever blister on my mouth. i don't know why this happened, but it was bothersome. i applied it after cleansing skin at night and made sure my skin was completely dry before i put any on and i used a small amount, which was sometimes hard to spread around."
1,"singulair dramatically reduced coughing spells and allergy symptoms, but if just one treatment was missed the allergy symptoms reaccured. none take one  mg tablet each night before bedtime."
1,"the benefits were that once i started taking it, i became less emotional when i got upset.  i could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  it evened out my moods so that i was less tempermental. if i missed taking a dose, i would feel a bit lightheaded, dizzy or have a headache.  too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood. after a break-up, i was very depressed and upset all the time.  i began taking a dose of mg and within a few days, noticed a difference.  i had fewer dramatic mood swings, and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  i did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication, and i feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  i continue to take this medication because i have been told i have a natural chemical imbalance, and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  overall, i feel i benefit from taking it, and unless i miss a dose, i have no side effects."
0,"there really weren't any - i didn't feel any better as the stressors in my life were still there.  i did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, i felt worse. i couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  it sometimes made me agitated too. i really wasn't comfortable with taking prozac in the first place - i had a crappy hmo doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  i really just needed a change in my life (job, living in dc) to reverse my depression.  in other words, i think my depression was situational, not a chemical imbalance.  i know that these do work for many people, but i think it's imperative that a person know why they are depressed before they hit the pharmacy."
0,"did improve my appetite, which was suffering as a result of the depression. mild weight gain. period of tiredness for two hours or so after each dose. very hard to wake up in the mornings. was prescribed as an alternative to citalopram. had virtually no effect on my depression whatsoever. in the period of winding down the citalopram dose then the  weeks on mirtazapine i went from mildly depressed / just about coping to suicidal, unable to cope and deeply depressed most of the time. would advise anyone who gets rapidly worsening depression after a med change to see the doctor again far sooner than i did."
1,"i had deepening frown lines on my forehead and between my eyes....the benefits were a decrease of the lines (wrinkles). i had a mild headache for a couple of days after my injections.  also, my forehead felt ""numb"" as if i had had a tooth pulled. now, when i raise my eyebrows, my eyebrows go up and the middle of my forehead stays still.  it looks a bit strange. i had  units of dysport injected into my forehead in about  different places. i was told to not bend over or lie back for a few hours or touch my forehead after the treatment.  i followed my doctors instructions. it has been over a week since the injections and there is still a mild wrinkle between my eyes.  the wrinkle is definitely not as deep looking as it was but it is still visible. i would probably have this done again although the results are not perfect."

1,"within days, the acne disappeared. when taken continuously for - months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  we then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone. spironolactone caused occasional leg cramping.  the lo-ovral caused some water retention. spironolactone was taken  mg a day and then increased after  months to  mg twice a day.  the lo-ovral was taken each day.  the laser hair removal was every  weeks.  the acne was completely under control.  when the ocp was stopped, the acne returned."

1,retin-a provided the benefits of reducing sun damage of the skin. it reduced some fine wrinkles and helped with uneven skin. the side effects experienced were mainly red irritation and peeling. there was also an occasional bout of acne breakouts. the use also led to a couple of times when the skin felt like it had been burnt or had a sever sunburn. treatment was for sun damage to the skin. the retin-a was applied daily in the evening. it was advised not to use it durig the day since it could lead to excessive exposure of the sun.

it was a good drug when it worked, but unfortunately it didn't last very long.  it also acts on serotonin like an ssri and started my dependency on ssris."

1,"i did not have any other conditions.  just an inability to focus, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.  i had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  i also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  i had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired, and i also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  the  concerta really helped me control all of those things. some of the side affects that i had were:  my stomach would hurt sometimes and other times it was difficult to eat without getting queezy.  i didn't have much of an appetite.  when the medicine wore off, it seemed to have a strong rebound effect and things became difficult for me during that last several hours of my day. i liked taking the medication, i just wish it would have lasted longer during the day.  by p-pm it had wore off and that seemed to by my busiest time of day with the kids, dinner and house stuff all at once. the treatment details were pretty basic.  i just took the medication in the morning at the same time of day every day.  i was allowed to skip it on the weekends or less busy times if i so desired.  i really don't have anything else to put for this section of the survey.  i'm trying to fill up the  word requirement though.  you shouldn't really have that requirement on this form.  it seems kind of silly to be writing with nothing left to say."
0,"hair loss all but stopped - kept crown area full. brain fog, difficulty calling up names, places, or specific details at times. very annoying. slight loss of libido, erections affected very, very slightly (takes a small amount more time to achieve full). started years ago when i saw hair falling out slowly. worked extremely well, but saw more negative reviews over the years and felt more sluggish (in my mind) over time. decided its not worth it, and am off it cold turkey as of  days ago. feeling tired, and libido is lacking. hoping i get back to my old self asap. i would not recommend this drug to anyone... hair is great, feeling % is way better. looking back? i'd leave it alone."
1,"instantly i felt relieved. i am able to stand back a bit from things that would previously really upset me. i am therefore able not to let things get to me,fantastic. so now i don't  explode instantly in anger at things anymore, i tried to think myself calm and non reactive previously but it did not work. with zoloft i have a calmness when meeting things that would normally make me enraged .i have time and mental space to be rational and realistic and can choose a sane quiet and dignified response, not aggression and anger. hallelujah. i felt very nauseous. and dizzy. but these subsided after one month. till then i made sure i ate something with taking the tablet to minimize the discomfort.  it was a very very unpleasant sensation of nausea and a kind of vertigo, but the benefits outweighed the negatives. even though it was quite a strong feeling of sickness, very very strong. it has passed now though. thankfully. i considered stopping the zoloft because it was so bad, but if i went back to my old pattern of sadness and anxiety and arguing my husband may seriously have left me. so i persevered. glad i did too. cos the sickness has disapated. i take  mg tablet. one a day in the morning with food."

1,"the drug has a very long half life and because of that property there is a long, smooth sustained effect of the drug. i did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew i was taking it except it helped my anxiety. occasional dry mouth i could not take any anti-depressant medications. i tried them all but had terrible side effects. my doctor is extremely good with medication therapy for depression and anxiety and decided i have a serotonin sensitivity and so put me on this drug which works on a different endorphin pathway called gabba. i have had terrific success on it and although it too has addictive properties like other diazapenes, i have not had to increase my dose at all therefore he doesn't think true physiological dependence is developing."

1,"the sores became much less painful very soon, on the nd day. overall, the healing was much faster, and there were only two pills a day to take (not  x  times a day, like with old-times acyclovir), which was convenient as i have a chronic gastritis, my stomach rarely agrees with oral treatments, so i felt minor irritation, a bit of heartburn, but nothing serious i had had herpes for years before i was prescribed valtrex (previous treatments were acyclovir). it was prescribed on the second day after the sores appeared and i noticed the improvement the next day - the pain was almost gone. i took two pills per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, for  days, after which the remission was longer than the previous ones (sometimes, the outbreaks happened as often as every two weeks), about two months. 
after that, i started taking  pills of valtrex the day i started feeling the outbreak (a nasty, gnawing feeling in the area where the sores would appear) and if it does not prevent the outbreak entirely, it lasts much shorter, is much less painful, and each time the remissions are rather long."
1,"woke up feeling a little less like a zombie, no more insomia. out of sorts, falling if i get up when medication has taken affect. i take this medication for severe narcolepsy. it has helped with the feeling of not sleeping at all when i would wake up the next morning. however, if you do not get into bed and stay for about  hours you can fall and do things you don't even realize you are doing. i got up to use the bathroom a few times on this medication and once i fell into the bathtub and also have fallen asleep on toilet if i have gotten up to use the bathroom. it can take affect very quickly if you have an empty stomach. there was a time i thought i had at least  minutes before it put me to sleep but i hadn't eaten much and it kicked in in  minutes. i fell asleep talking to my fiance. it literally knocks you out like when you are put under anesthesia for surgery. it can be very dangerous but it is quite affective for helping you sleep and go into the refreshing cycles of sleep."

i would not recommend taking this with alcohol, especially something like tequila which is an upper. combined with alcohol i experienced wild abandon, loss of inhibitions and total change in personality, i am usually quite reserved, but became quite the opposite - which sorted the libido out, but still unable to climax. my treatment involved psychotherapy as well as the medication."

i had gone camping and run out of imitrex.  i was in pain for about  hours when i was taken to a little emergency clinic. they gave me an injection of  miligrams and in about  minutes i was pain free and feeling normal. sometimes a little queasiness if taken on an empty stomach.  sometimes a little fatigue and a feeling of slight slowness. my insurance only covers  pills every  days, so my physician prescribes  miligram caplets and i cut them in half to give more dosages.  the caplets work well if the migraine is caught early. i most often wake up with the migraine starting and will take my pill and lie back down with a cold cloth or ice pack for  minutes to  hours depending on how advanced the pain is. 

if i catch it really early the pain stops progressing and i feel well with in  minutes to an hour.

if the maigraine has progressed too far the caplets don't work and i use a self injection of the  miligram dosage which works within  to  minutes without much side effect.

1,"calming effect, helped with sleep, helped with concentration, reduced appetite, improved depressive symptoms nausea at first, agitation at first, sleeplessness initially. it seemed to take away my sense of urgency for things a bit, which was good for alleviating anxiety but might have caused difficulties with timeliness at work and time management overall. long history of add symptoms eventually diagnosed at age . had to stop taking medicine because i left job and health insurance lapsed. this medicine was far more effective for me than adderal, which caused me to be very emotionally labile and sensitive, and caused dramatic blood sugar drops. i really wish i could go back on strattera, it really felt right for me."
1,"after taking adderall xr for about a year, my doctor switched me to vyvanse.  vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of adhd that i was experiencing, but it does so for about  hours.  with adderall xr, the effects lasted only a few hours, and i experienced a crash after the effects wore off and i instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  with adderall xr, i also lost the desire to eat.  i am hungry with vyvanse, and do have the desire to eat.  with vyvanse, i do not feel the crash at the end of the day, and i do not experience any moodiness.  i am very please with this drug, and it has changed my life for the better.  i have reccommended it to other family members with the same problems that i have and they have shared with me similar success stories. the only side effect i experience is times of having a slightly dry mouth.  the dry mouth i experienced with adderall was much worse. i take one mg pill a day in the morning. i don't take it with food and it does not bother my stomach at all."
1,"in the case of a panic attack, this would soothe the anxiety and calm me down-a numbing sensation--a highly effective anti-psychotic in several situations--kept a low-level feeling of calmness and barrier to anxiety/stress unfortunately, weight gain was a marked side effect, and led me to take a lower dose--also in high doses, i almost felt like a zombie--totally numb and emotionless--a disturbing concept. prescribed by my psychiatrist to use in various doses over several years of use to use for anxiety and panic, and in conjunction with klonopin as an effective measure to reduce a mixed/manic episode of bipolar disorder in an acute situation, and also at a low-level dose every day to reduce the chance of episodes from occuring. good tool in anger management as well."

0,"botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  the  and  unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about  months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the  units.  the  units were as effective but without the spasms noted under treatment details.  of the  times  units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended  hours.  there was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous  unit injection.  more detail is covered under the treatment details. side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  blurry vision.  this lasted for approximately  days. the first use of botox was  units. injections were  injections on the upper-mid forehead.  injections were given around the outer side of each eye. within  hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  the forehead was totally stiff. upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   i make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  i realize that botox is available in  or  unit vials, which are then reconstituted. the nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the unit vial)because it would be instable after  hours.    
   since this time, i have had units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  there was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  the  units and  units lasted about - months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   i recently had only  units injected mid-upper forehead in - injections. upon raising my eyebrows i needed (i thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  after one month, i find that i have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  my main concern is :  if physicians, agents  have only  - unit vials available, and they are only injecting  client, what do they do with the residual.  is this why there is such a high cost  $ - $ per unit??  it makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the  hour expiration time.  have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  this last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled."

through the past two years i was diagnosed with shuermann's kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. throughout the past two years i have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, ie. vicodin es,percocet,ms contin etc.. i knew enough was enough, so like that i stopped taking them. i have no side effects whatsoever. i have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( th session  session is  weeks ) and been too four orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. my doctor and i discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. i am no pro, but i know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. my doctor and i talked about cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so i am not experiencing so much pain. i also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. recently my aunt and uncle passed away which they practically raised me when i was born in ireland, and my sister's deaths was even more of a add on. i felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and i feel like a new person. i find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. i am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. i am enrolled and taking college courses which i have  more semesters left before i receive my degree. in one of my classes (chemistry) we are assigned a science experiment. mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will i am using cymbalta. i recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. i am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. i have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. but for me it is working, and i am consistent in my daily routine. i shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription. i have no side effects at the moments. this drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. i feel that this has a mixed review. for me i was given two weeks of trials, and then  refills. so my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. it takes - weeks for a human to become physically and mentally dependant. i am very pleased overall otherwise.  pill (mg) per day, in the morning."

0,"none bleeding not even spotting ladies: i am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking seasonique (please do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. i would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. i normally have  -  days menstrual periods every month. but i was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described  periods only per year (wow! what a great idea, especially i have small child, school, work, and husband). guess what happen since then? i have been bleeding almost  weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is i get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, i have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can i be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (i am sure no woman likes that), and so on. i spoke with my ob, and she said it's normal. i don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. i have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. no wonder it is called birth control. how can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? i stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

ladies: i am not saying all the women's body are the same. but if you want to be on this drug. i would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for  periods per year, you may want to think twice. because it's a mother nature for women that has  menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. otherwise, please consider something else. i am so regret that i did not read all the comments and reviews before i asked my ob to put me on this drug. therefore, i have to suffer what i deserve (i guess). i just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as i finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before i made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. for me, ""no is no"". you can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. but let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

final words...... good luck if you are on this prescription, and i hope you win, if not, you defintely need these words ""good luck""! :)"

1,"helped anxiety & black moods, headaches.  made my life a happier place to be in, especially for my family.  have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain. would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins, highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably. doctor prescribed lexapro when i had seen him about black moods & depression which is something i have had on and off since i was very young.   depression was starting to effect my family life so felt i needed to see a doctor, he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  i was prescribed mg and take one tablet daily.  i visit the doctor regularly to update progress on lexapro"

1,the drug was to prevent further infections which were starting to scar the kidneys. after taking the drug my daughter did not have any more infections. it was a low level dose and did not seem to affect her in any way e.g causing digestive problems. there were none i  ml spoon was to be taken in the morning and evening
0,"we aren't sure.  we wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  we are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  she was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  she was completely weaned off of carbatrol at one point and went almost  weeks with no seizure activity.  she also went -/ months with no seizure activity with keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  due to her history of seizures (started at the age of  a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. we hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  the goal is to get her back under complete control. the main side effect we noticed with keppra was weight loss.  she dropped  lbs. in less than a month.  she had a very suppressed appetite for the first  or  months.  she has since gained back maybe  lbs. but continues to have a suppressed appetite just not as much as at first. she takes  pills in the morning upon waking and  pills at night before going to bed.  she was taking  klonopin pill but is now taking lamictal and is gradually increasing the dosage.  her neurologist is weaning her off of keppra and gradually moving her to lamictal."

1,"greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof. lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy. with or without this medication i am a philosopher. so i will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

background:
i had taken strattera for three years (-) where it helped control add where i had difficulty doing so. it helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits i listed prior. i dropped the drug for  years so that i may learn how to control my add without the help of medication. during those three years i gained remarkable self control in overcoming add. however, i got to the point where i couldn't win over add, which was losing focus randomly. during college lectures that i found very intriguing i would often zone out/space out when i could not have been more interested in what was being professed. the frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

on the drug:
i read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. from an evaluative standpoint of myself, i've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. in other words, if i felt a need for a happiness at a th strength before, i now had the need for happiness at a th strength. since happiness, to me and most i'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because i now do not need to be happy as much as before).

understand that this drug does not control me, i control this drug. i suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. as you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug."
1,"the viral load count was reduced from millions to less than a hundred within  months. though the virus cannot be completely removed, reduction in number helped my physiological health in addition to the physical. i've been continuing taking the drugs, and would likely continue until  years. none but cash and bank a/c were emptied!!! daily intake of mg tab. viral load check every  months together with alt, ast and complete blood count."
1,"extreme urticaria (hives) on forearms and mild (hives) on face and legs were near completely cured with the zantac. no side effects that i remember i had horrible rashes on my forearms, the right one especially, that were extremely itchy. i tried topical anti-itch creams and put ice on it to soothe the itching but nothing relieved my symptoms more than slightly. i thought it would eventually go away by itself. after suffering for  or  weeks i went to my doctor. he took  look at my arms and said i had hives. probably due to seasonal allergies. he wrote a prescription for zantac and sent me on my way. within the st day of taking the medication my hives were less than half than they'd been. within a week they were nearly gone."
1,"my stomach aches went away. i wasn't as nauseated as i would have been without anything. i have been getting headaches sporadically and the doctor said this is a possbile side effect. also, i was very nauseated the first  weeks, which they say happens in % of the population taking this drug, but then it subsided. i am taking this medication after being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. i was on zelnorm for this and it was like a miracle drug!! it fixed all my problems for months, then it went off the market. the doctor then told me to try this as an option. it definately helps more than not taking anything at all and i can tell when i get these stomach pains that i forgot to take the drug."

1,"completely cleared resistant adult cystic acne that had not responded to any topical meds or to accutane. none. i had regular blood tests to check liver function, but had no negative reactions of any type. fifteen years of dermatologists, peels, topicals, accutane, and nothing had cleared my cystic acne and constant breakouts, though a few treatments lessened the severity. flutamide mg b.i.d. took one month to take effect, and within  weeks completely cleared ongoing resistant acne that had lasted more than  years and was worsening in my late s. after one year, we tried weaning off the drug. the results lasted for about  months, before the acne gradually returned. went back on flutamide, and a month later the acne had left. we are now trying to see if a lesser maintenance dose is possible."

1,"the ibuprofen helped relieve pain and swelling from the sprained ankle. it lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain. there were no treatment side effects except for occasional nausea or drowsiness. drowsiness however helped the patient sleep faster and thus avoid discomfort of laying in bed with a sprained ankle. overall it simply lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. three two-hundred milligram tablets of ibuprofen were taken for two weeks daily. the sprained-ankle caused substantial pain, discomfort and swelling. in order to begin the healing process and rehabilitation of the ankle's flexibility, ibuprofen was taken. ibuprofen allowed the lessening of swelling and also resulted in a subsiding of pain and thus a faster healing process. side-effects were low and insignificant though there might be effects if taken in the long term."
1,"lower blood pressure in combination with hyzaar none i am aware of. taken once daily in combination with hyzaar. my condition apparently responded best to the two medications.  however, my doctor said that recent discussions have gone against taking the two classes of antihypertensives so i am now on an increased dose of hyzaar."

1,"primarily, my son was much better able to focus, control his impulsivity and, as a result, did better in school.  our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could. initially, he experienced some sleepiness, but he adjusted to the medication and no longer has this problem. we were initially reluctant to treat an otherwise healthy boy for what some describe as ""boy"" behavior, but he was increasingly frustrated with his inability to get along with siblings and classmates.  however, seeing now how much it has helped him - without making him into a different person -- we're glad we did."

1,"marked reduction in redness & flushing and complete elimination of pustules.  ease of use over creams, etc. none  pill every morning at least one hour before eating.  topical medications were a hassle to use consistently, were seldom ""cosmetically elegant"", and did very little to keep symptoms from escalating.  dermatologist prescribed oracea when it became obvious the the topicals were never going to control the pustules.  oracea cleared it up in a couple of weeks and gave consistent results throughout treatment - rosacea was practically forgotten about - with no side effects.  several months after discontinuing use, pustles have returned but are nothing like before treatment and are manageable with otc topicals.  expensive but oracea does offer discounts worth looking into."
0,"the treatment benefits were marginal at best.  mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that ssris are only effective in the most severe of cases. on the plus side, i experienced no major side effects.  the possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  however, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal. the pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  the prescribing physician recommended taking lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects."
1,"my acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to retin-a!  it helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began. peeling, dryness, sun sensitivity i applied a small amount of retin-a every evening before bed and washed if off in the morning.  if you are able to get through the initial stage which includes the side effects  (peeling, dry skin, redness, irritation, and sun sensitivity) your skin will emerge better looking and healthier in the end."

0,"none really.  at the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep. it wasn't long until i became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. i think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  the major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  there were a number of times that i'd forgotten if /or how much i had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. it should be classified as a schedule  drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. i think this drug should be taken off of the market. there aren't any treatment details.  the pain management physician prescribed the medication each monthly visit and increased the dosage not long after introducing the drug as treatment.  these kinds of physicians are really drug dealers cloaked in an dea approved office."
1,"i did not experience the ""brain-fog"" that i did with celexa. i felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely. i was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking effexor. thankfully, this side-effect abated after two weeks. i've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from / to maybe /-. after using celexa for  years, it decreased in its helpfulness. celexa always made me feel like i was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. immediately after taking effexor, i felt the fog lift and i can't begin to tell you how relieved i am,  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. i still have moments where i feel a little anxious, but as a whole, the depression is being taken care of. when i noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye, i stopped taking the drug. my eyesight seemed to return to normal. oddly, my left eye is fine, but it was always extraordinarily good."

1,"the benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. i used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. i did use accutane for about  months to clear it up. however, i still breakout. not with cysts but smaller pimples. they seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. i have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. my face is also less oily. the only side effects were temporary breast discomfort. i swear they got bigger. that however did subside and i no longer have that discomfort. the other side effect is frequent urination. if i drink a lot of water during the day i have to go all the time but even if i don't i still have to when i drink water or whatever. it's a little annoying but the pros far out weigh the cons. i simply take one  mg pill a day after i have eaten and drink plenty of water. i usually take it in the morning. i use spironolactone in conjuntion with ziana topical cream. this combination has really helped to basically rid me of acne. thank goodness, since i am almost  years old and it is embarrassing to still get acne. i love this stuff!"
0,i became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. i was a better mother and wife. i could focus and was not lethargic or sad. the side effects mostly were related to low sex drive. i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and then depression. i was treated first for the hypothyroidism and then the depression. the zoloft worked but i still felt like i had a lower than normal energy level. my doctor added in the wellbutrin to give me the energy boost.

1,"after the first few days my anxiety was greatly reduced. i felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that i had been having prior to starting this medication. i was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression. at first i had some mild nausea, which went away and then i didn't have any side effects. this medication did not make me gain weight and it did not lower my sex drive- both which were concerns for me. the medication worked great, and i would have rated it a  except getting off the medication was difficult. for six-eight weeks i had what i've come to learn are called brain zaps... a strange sensation that is difficult to describe and not pleasant. lucky for me i had read about this so it did not scare me... otherwise i would have been very concerned. i pretty much just rode it out for those - weeks and then it went away and i've been fine. if i had to do it over i would still have chosen to take the lexapro because is was so effective for my anxiey/depression which was off the charts when i started."

1,"my hair loss that i was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and i actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  every individual to whom i've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  i'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on. while they are forced to tell you that there is something like a % chance of becoming temporarily impotent, even for the people that effects the literature says that the majority of that small number get back their sex drive while continuing to take the drug. if you stop taking the drug it comes back immediately. i've not experienced any lessening of my libido, nor has anyone else that i've recommended the drug to. you have to have a doctor's prescription, but to avoid the annoyance and price of a doctor's visit you can go to several websites that allow you to pay an extra fee, fill out a questionaire and then have a doctor who is on their payroll give you the prescription. that is okay because really if you're having hair loss and you know you are, why do you need a dermatolagist to tell you- ""yeah, you're losing your hair""? it's an idiotic rule that makes this a controlled drug.  anyway you take one pill a day- that's it, with or without meals."

0,"the benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). i noticed that less hairs in the m shape were falling out. it also regrew some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. i also noticed that thin, weak hairs regrew stronger and thicker. side effect were a feeling of tiredness and lowered libido. these side effects passed away after my body adapted to the lower dht levels in the body. propecia is a medication that is used to treat prostate cancer. it does inhibit dht(dihydrotestosterone)that is the most potent form of testosterone. it also raises testosterone levels by %.

propecia is also a treatment for male pattern baldness. dht is known to bind to the receptor on the hair follicle. by doing this the hair will eventually die for those with genetic mpb. by using propecia the dht levels will be lowered, and you hair will not be affected as much as if you did not use propecia.

1,"the benefits were numerous, i don't have panic attcks for the first time in  yrs, and if i do, they are less than  seconds.  i haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it  years ago.  these symptoms continued to get more severe until i got on this drug.  every episode was worse and lasted longer.  this drug gave me my life back.  i lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  but i have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  i have to admit, to get to the point i'm at now took  years, but it's better then i was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  the longer i'm on seroquel, the better i feel.  also, i am able to sleep because of seroquel.  at the worst when i went into the hospital i couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired i couldn't even function in day to day life.  seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  i also don't feel too tired in the morning. there are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  i have a little more stomach troubles than what i started with but that could be due to the lithium.  i have also had about  pounds of weight gain.  before the seroquel i was thin with a high metabolism.  my weight is steady now, but at  lbs higher than it used to be.  i tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  the drug doesn't make me groggy but i know some people on it that it just knocks out. i have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  i tried zyprexa, depakote triliptal and lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or i had severe reactions to them.  i have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  i tried risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  i started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  later i switched to seroquel and paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  i was on seroquel at a lower dose than most mg to start, mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and paxil at mg.  now  years later, as i am not in a severe episode i can get by on half the paxil,  mg seroquel and the lowest lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  i raise the doses if i have to (with permission of the nurse practitioner)and i take -mg seroquel as needed throughout the day if i need to for anxiety, although i don't need to very often.  the combination of seroquel, paxil and lithium works best together for me."

1,"early this year i started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using lancome eye cream.  though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  i was very self conscious about the wrinkles. after using renova (i've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic. for the initial two weeks, where i applied renova caused a stinging sensation and a mild redness.  my eyes were watery for a few weeks as well.  also, for that initial few weeks, the skin looked dry and the wrinkles looked worsened in that one-hour ""drug-work"" duration for which i didn't put on any moisturizer.  all the symptoms are gone now, and the skin is denser and firmer and i no longer fear people looking at my wrinkles anymore. i asked the doctor to prescribe renova to me."

0,"i have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  it started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which i have anything positive to report.  in college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, i got my head above water.  i was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  i thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about  years i might be able to feel happiness.  since then i went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended i try cymbalta.  i feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  so now i know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water. none of the previous meds i mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  the wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  that was a relief.  the ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  i was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that i didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  the cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  plus, i'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  it seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  i do not yet know if this is working (like i said, i have no boyfriend so i don't even know why i'm bothering.  really i did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  i haven't felt much difference. once a month i see a psychiatrist, although i am ""in between"" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  i have been without a therapist for a while now, wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.  i am  beginning to think that now is a good time to go back to it.  i consider the jogging, yoga, healthy eating and vitamins i take to be a part of my treatment."

1,"for the first time in years i woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. i woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. i could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. if work got crazy and i had to pull - hrs - which was quite frequent - i didn't get immediately sick.  i actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. i used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. when i take xyrem i need only - hours of sleep and i would wake up and feel great throughout the day. it was an absolute lifesaver for me. i had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. i had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), i lost a few lbs and i could eat whatever and not gain much weight. my testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places i didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. i also had problems with short term memory, though i did before when i was in a fibro-fog too. so off the medicine i have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  it is a shame because i used to have a great memory. i would take  gms before bed. wake up . to  hrs later for second dose.  it was easy to wake up, many times i would wake up on my own. sometimes i would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the  hr mark. if i didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to  or more hrs of sleep every night. that was not always practical for me. i started off at the  gms dose twice per night and never had to change. sometimes, depending on the time of month i got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only . hrs later and get around  hrs of sleep a night. depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes i couldn't wake up so i would lessen my second dose to . gms so i could wake up at  hrs after the dose."

graying of the teeth, especially lower teeth, bluish at roots. lethargy, lack of concentration. my acne/ rosacea began at age , and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products, with poor result. i began taking high doses of tetracyclean at age . by age  i was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. i never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. by age , i was introduced to minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. within - years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. two weeks ago i phased out of the minocycline and adopted a strong probiotic (  billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. i continue to use the topical clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. i am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which acne and rosacea thrive on. rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers. been on antibiotics for  years, and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. the supplement can be found on candidafreedom. they also make a natural face soap with the same ingredients. get off those horrible drugs and at least try it. give yourself a month !"

0,"absolutely none after two days on levaquin i began to notice calf muscle and tendon issues. by day three it was becoming an issue when sitting down and getting up, to the point where i thought i might rupture the achilles tendon. i had never had any issues in my lower legs before. by day four i was having a lot of trouble walking and could only shuffle around. i stopped taking the drug and requested a different antibiotic. on reading up on it, i discovered i it should never have been prescribed for me - i am  years old and being treated with corticosteroids for ra. it was prescribed by the er physician and my family doctor. i stopped taking the drug after  days. it took me - weeks to be able to walk normally again. in the rd week we had plans to go to a wedding out of the country, and i required wheelchair assistance at the three aiports we went through to get there. i would have missed my flights if i had had to walk."
1,"first of all there are a ton of competitors like rogaine on these reviews bashing propecia, how can you only take it for  months and have side effects that have ruined your life, i find that highly unlikely. second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline % of the time you won't. i have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about  seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about - months in so u gotta give it time. not as bad as i was expecting, don't let some little drug mess with your mind man your bigger than that. if any i would say a lower libidio but i kind of like it because before propecia i was wanking off like  times a day and now its like once or every other day. propecia is cool just do research, actually this shit is too expensive but if u care about your hair i would recommend it."

1,i was taking flexeril for muscle inflammation in my ribs caused by sever coughing from bronchitis.  it helped with the pain a lot and helped me sleep through the night. i didn't experience any side effects.  it did make me tired but i expected that.  i did feel a bit hung over the next day like you would if you took tylenol pm or similar.  i'd recommend taking it when you know you have - hours to sleep. flexeril has been highly effective for my pain.
1,"the treatments stopped my monthly acne breakouts.  this allowed my skin to heal and broke the breakout cycle.  my skin has not wrinkled as fast as my friends of the same age. at first i had dry skin. i used it every other day rather than every day until my skin adjusted.  other than the initial dry, peeling skin, i had no side affects. i applied the retin-a to my face every night.  at my dermatologists suggestion, i did not wash my face before applying the cream.  as mentioned above, when i first started treatment, i used the product every other day until my skin adjusted to the retin-a micro"

0,"the pain was definitely reduced, from high discomfort to relatively low discomfort, so long as i wasn't moving. it also helped me to sleep some of the time. during the second and third day, it seemed to increase my post-surgical nausea. overall, in addition to drowsiness, i experienced a lot of dizziness. i'm not sure whether or not it affected my bowels returning to normal function. at first i was given the oxycodone intravenously, with a button allowing me to choose when i wanted a dose (don't remember the amount) but limited in total amount and frequency (up to every  minutes, i think.) afterwards, i took it in pill form. after several days i decided the side effects were too strong and  got a hydrocodone prescription, which had similar but more mild side effects. in retrospect, i wish that acupunture had been available; when i experienced an auricular -needle protocol several weeks later, i found the residual pain i had was immediately reduced, with none of the side effects."

0,"the treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that i experienced. i don't think i benefited at all from taking this drug. this drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. i really was never relieved from my clinical depression because i kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day i realized that i had to stop taking it. after about  months, i realized that i was very agitated constantly. i just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. my nervousness was getting extreme. one day, i was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. i was so agitated that i had an intense desire to ram him with my shopping cart. i realized that this behavior was not me and that the lexapro was causing the severe rage. i also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as i could and not stop. i also couldn't sleep at night and if i was able to go to sleep finally, i would only stay asleep for a few hours. i sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage. this medication is manufactured by forest pharmaceuticals, inc., a subsidiary of forest laboratories, inc. in st. louis missouri . i was given the prescription of taking  mg. once a day. i cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if i had taken the full dosage recommended of  mg. i would have probably hurt someone badly. i have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. right now, paxil is helping me with my depression a little. i think that i need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. i had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. i was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. i just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when i had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as i stated before in this report, that i had to quit taking lexapro. sometimes, i would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. my therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. i was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. that was no way to live. this medication was so toxic to me that if i had not realized what it was doing to me, i might have even taken my own life. because of my great faith in god, i didn't kill myself and finally realized that i had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what lexapro was doing to me. i also have a friend who is taking lexapro and has taken it for sometime. she also shows signs of rage at times. just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as i did). i have tried to tell her that she needs to get off lexapro but she just thinks that other people are intimidating her. one day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that lexapro is not the drug for her either. i really do think that lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. i would never recommend this drug to anyone. it is just too unstable."
1,i feel better about myself and less anxious and depressed. i have taken it for almost two weeks now and i feel really tired and increased yawning. i have taken it during the day and at night which in the morning  i feel tired still. i take it once a day at mg per pill. i do better on it now then i do without it. so i will keep my fingers crossd and hope the sleepness goes away.
1,"the benefit was a lowering of blood sugar and metformin does that very well without leading to hypoglycemia which can happen with some of the other anti-hyperglycemic drugs. side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea but this usually goes away in about - weeks. metformin  mg taken twice a day. this controlled by blood sugar but it is important to realize that the medication does not peak until about - hours after it is taken. this is important knowledge to have in order to time the administration of the drug. when i took it too close to dinner time, it was not as effective as when i took it - hours before dinner. i wish my healthcare provider or pharmacist had told me when it peaked but that information came from a diabetes educator. i got better control after i knew when to take my dose."

1,"i was finally able to get the deep sleep that i needed to function. other problems that i have- interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, insomnia, etc.- seem to be improving because of the sleep that i am getting. i seem to have periods of vomiting that last for several days. it happens monthly and i really am not sure what interacts with medicine those days and not the others. i did build up to my dosage .mg every  days to try and limit the effects. i take the medicine about  minutes before i go to bed because i only get about - hours of relief."
1,it reduced my acne considerably. it provided a very smooth feeling to my skin that i did not experience with anything prior to using this medicine. it also gave me a rosier complexion with a glow. the only side effects i experienced were a slight stinging feeling. this subsided after the first two weeks. if the stinging sensation does not subside it is preferable to use it every other night instead of every night. i used this every night after cleansing my face. i waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before the application. it was also recommended by my doctor to wear sunscreen the next morning since this medication causes skin sun sensitivity.
1,"i had several episodes of extremely high blood pressure / was one reading.  it was mainly a product of work related stress and being overweight.  first i was treated with prozac for the depression/anxiety and became suicidal.  with the paxil and lisinopril combination my blood pressure is controlled and i do not suffer from depression nor anxiety.  i respond to outside stimuli in a more normal way. none lisinopril  tablet  mg daily, paxil initially was  mg increased to  mg. daily."
0,"absolutely none. this drug destroyed my marriage. i was so irrationally angry over really stupid stuff. i was raging at my husband for no reason. and it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. i have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. i would pull this drug from the market. irrational rage. it has nothing to do with my mental state but the fact that the drug does this to everyone. you have to let it build up in your system because your body is trying to reject a poison. you become addicted. no different than cocaine or speed freaks. it is such a lie. once a day. i was drooling as i slept. when i could sleep. i was edgy all the time. i was in a brain fog. and nobody knew that i wasn't crazy. this damn drug was making me crazy. i told my stupid shrink that i needed to be calmer and he gave me speed. i told him i was getting irrationally upset and he doubled the dose. i have been seriously depressed and screwed up emotionally and physically for three years.  i want to sue the drug company.

0,"my anger and depression seemed to get much better within  weeks of starting on  mg. my dose was eventually increased over time to mg.  my family noticed a difference in my attitude. at first i was very tired so instead of taking the dosage in the morning, i switched to bedtime. my depression is better over the years but i have less desire for sex.  i have found it tremendously difficult to maintain or loose weight.  the weight problem seems to have increased over the years to a point where i would like to try and stop or at least decrease the medication.  the problem is that when i wanted to have a rd child, i decided to discontinue the medication and the effects of stopping effexor were horrible.  i have seen problems when i miss a dosage so i am scared to try and stop the medicine.  before i when i ""weaned"" off the medication i had severe headaches, nausea, and dizziness. i am worried about trying to quit again but i  am having such problems with trying to loose weight that i want to try."
1,"before taking prozac i had no energy or joy - i could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. i just wanted to stay in bed. when i first started taking it, i could feel it physically - i felt a little ""giddy"" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. but over time, those feelings went away and i just felt normal. i no longer felt like i was on a drug - i just felt good. i could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day. i had very vivid dreams/nightmares the entire time i took it. eight years later, i can still remember many of them and the way they made me feel. i gained weight (from lbs to lbs). i began by taking mg tablets one time a day for one week. the next week i increased to mg tablets on time/day. i took prozac for one year. when i stopped taking it i reduced the dosage to mg tablets one time a day for about  weeks. i did not have any ill effects when i quit taking it."
0,"depression reduced - i had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - i suddenly felt a % better after  a week or so - i had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect. i felt nauseous. gradually i became acclimatised the effects- so after the initial boost i felt normal again - like i could engage with life. after a while (-months) i felt like i was experiencing a distance because of the drugs, instead of feeling engaged in life like i had felt initially, i felt like i was veiled from it. i was prescribed increasing doses by my family doctor until he had reached the maximum () he could prescribe. i tried to commit suicide, i was referred to a psychiatrist who doubled the dose. after seeing the psychiatrist twice over  months. i did not have to see her again. and my family doctor could continue to prescribe at this higher dose."
0,"so far i've been sad to say the the side effects are worse for him. i want to continue the drug longer to hope that the side effects will decrease. trouble sleeping, more hostile behavior, emotional frustration, even more decreased appetite. we just changed from adderall xr to vyvanse because of a change in doctors from ohio to california. we were hoping for the more lasting effects of vyvanse with less side effects.  the verdict is still out."
1,"it was able to supress my hunger enough to ""get through"" the tough times and not be so grumpy about it :)  simply, i was not starving all the time, and it made the weight loss bearable.  it was not easy, but it gave me the drive to keep going because i wasn't so miserable while doing it. i ate a  calorie a day or less diet and exercised many times a week...so i would have lost weight anyway, but it just made it easier. dry mouth, constipation at times, sometimes felt a bit like my heart raced under stress after taking it for a long time. one tablet a day for about a year to help aid in weight loss.  i have been able to keep it off give or take a few pounds, almost a year later."

1,this product reduced the severity of the breakouts and reduced length of time of the acne outbreak.  it was effective in reducing the outbreak but it does not eliminate or reduce blackheads unless an inordinate amount of ointment is applied daily. generally a mild peeling occurred on the areas where the ointment was applied - some itchiness as well but not very often cleanse with a non abrasive facial cleanser and dry face.  then apply cream to the affected area
0,"this medication is manufactured to lower the bad cholesterol levels.
therefore it is produced to dicrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. after first month of usage the blood test should be performed . the dosage shall be adjusted accordingly and another three months treatment shall follow before another bloood test is done. i have observed the side effects on my husband, whom i have to remind every dayto take this pill.  first of all, he felt really sick, very nausceus. he had diarrhea for about first  weeks of treatment and although he is very physically active because he is  a farmer, therefore he excercise most of the day, the doctor told him it was not enough, he had to excerciseeven more. this medication was prescribed to my husband byhis doctor becasue he had shown for several years increased and then high cholesterol levels. he was presrcibed some another cholesterol lowering drug, but it was making him so sick, he asked doctor for lipitor, because he saw a commercial on tv. first, he got  days supply, one pill a day, then blood test was performed and dosage adjusted, actually confirmed. it appears he has less side effects with this drug than with previous one. he shall excercise, but he is very physically active, so he does not. the blood test has shown some decrease in bad cholesterol, but not enough and the doctor insists he must excercise more, but he does not. he is due next blood test, but had no time to go there , yet. he is on this pill for about - months."
1,"the side affects were not so bad. the pills were easy to take, and got them from publix so they were vanilla flavored. i had a yeast infection, and also a weird dry patch of skin on my bottom lip. the process was slow for me, and it did not work in two or three days like the doctor said. i did notice that each day it became easier and easier to swallow things."

1,"catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. for this reason i began taking betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.

a side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my rosacea symptoms. i have had the reason for this explained to me, but cannot recal the details (has something to do with catapres effect on the sympathetic nervous system). i experience slight sedation after taking catapres which is helpful for me as a light sleeper. i believe i experience some slight lethargy that is ongoing, but not troublesome. when i first started taking catapres i got a very dry mouth, but this quickly went away. i have experienced no other side effects that i am aware of. i'm not sure what this question means, and may have already answered it. i am taking catapres and betaloc for longstanding essential hypertension. i have noticed that when i take these two drugs together their individual effectiveness is amplified. i have been cautioned by my doctor that it is important not to suddenly stop taking this drug combination as this could cause a heart attack."

before beginning this treatment i had recurring bladder irritations that felt like a bladder infection.  when tested, there was never any bacteria present.  the urologist that i went to put me on this system of using a vaginal cream.  i began using it nightly until symptoms were relieved or disappeared.  following that i was put on a regimen of using the vaginal cream only  nights per week.

1,reduced sore throats and headaches due to allergies i have had few if any side effects from nasonex allergist prescribed nasonex years ago to combat my allergies without drying me out like many antihistimes.  i believe that this medication helped me avoid the recurring sinus infections that i had had in the past.
0,"reduced the blood pressure with few side effects at first dehydration - this problem grew as the years passed and i seemed to become more sensitive to the drug.  i finally started taking a / dose.  i had dry eyes, constipation, mouth breathing.   i would drink too much beer if i started drinking because i was so thirsty. dry skin became an irritating problem.  this problem has improved since i changed medications. the drug was very helpful at first.  it improved my concentration, my ability to focus and pay attention increased and i slept better.  as the years passed, i became aware that i was in a state of semi-dehydration much of the time.  this did not dawn on me until i had taken the drug for over seven years.  i started to keep water at my desk and drank a quart and a half on average every day just during the day at work.  this helped considerably, but the dry skin and constipation finally lead to my asking the doctor for a change.  i am curious if there is any connection between the dehydration and potential dementia."

1,"between  and , when i was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. after i received my bone density results in , my physician put me on fosamax, which i have taken regularly for the past two years.  when i took a bone density test recently in , my bone mineral density had increased by almost % over a two-year period. i remain in the range of osteopenia, but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my t-scores. i have experienced no adverse side effects at all while taking this medication. i take a pill in the morning when i get up, once a week, on the same day each week.  i take it with an  ounce glass of water and do not lay down, eat, or drink anything for at least  minutes. i also take calcium/d vitamin supplements daily, eat plenty of dairy products, walk at least  times a week, and avoid alcohol and soft drinks.  i was already following these dietary habits when my previous bone density tests were done.  because of that, i credit fosamax with the improvement  that has taken place."
1,"signifigantly reduced depression, social anxiety. mild side effects. forgetfullness, some manifestation of laissez-faire attitude (not caring as much about work issues, but in some ways this is a good thing! as long as you don't end up slacking off too much), harder to reach orgasm (but much better than paxil or prozac in this matter). i've been on effexor for about  years, and love it. it doesn't make you sleepy or passive. it doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

you may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. it started to poop out on me at about year , and since then i've been climbing with the dosage. 

i've tried many anti-depressants, and this is the gold standard for me. paxil robbed me of many years...no ambition, no focus, very sloppy housekeeping. effexor is much better."
0,"the benifit of taking the drug was to decrease the symptoms of depression and anxiety. in addition, the drug did not suppress the libido on the opposite it increase the sexual desire. side effects were many.  there was a decrease in energy levels and dizzines.  there was weight gain. at the end of the  days period the feelings of depression were still an issue the treatment consisted of taking mg every morning for thirty days.  also, started an exercise program to increase the endorphins levels in the brain.  the doctor suggested fifteen minutes of sunshine a day. after the thirty days period the follow up consisted of answering questions about the positive and negative  effects of the drug. after reviewing the answers it was determined that i needed to be on a higher dosage because the symptoms of depression were still an issue.  the increase in dosage was from mg to mg and still at the end of thirty days there was mo change in the symptoms.  finally i had to switch to another medication which so far it has worked fine."

1,"i lost  pounds in  months. the key was drinking water all throughout the day. i ate  meal a day before pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). i saw no results in the first month, but once  days had passed, i started to lose  lb. a day & sometimes  ' lb. a day. even after getting off of meridia, i still continued to lose weight  months later. product was very expensive but worth it! the more weight you have to lose the more you will lose! insomnia sometimes. my bedtime(before meridia) was around pm but once i began taking the medicine, i couldn't sleep sometimes until am or am, but even with lack of sleep, i never felt fatigued like i thought i would. every once in a while, mild headaches & dry mouth. but nothing too major or life-threatening. lost  lbs. in - months. kept the weight off even to this day ( years later) b/c the meridia taught me the key to weight loss: less calorie intake. and since the meridia trained my body to get full quicker, i was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication."
1,"reduced depression and feelings of hopelessness within  weeks. i like being able to increase dosage when things get a little rough and then back off to the original dosage when things settle down. extreme sleepiness, feeling ""out of it"".  it was really hard to work and be on this medication.  i wanted to give it up as i literally could not stay awake but i made it though the first  weeks and things were better after that.  i have been on it for  years now and do not notice any side effects. took pill once a day and visited therapist once a month.  after awile, i didn't go to the therapist anymore and i was extremely even with just the medication."

0,"flare-ups were less frequent as well and the duration of time they lasted was less. i noticed that it didn't help with the amount of bowl movements i was having but it did help stop the internal bleeding. nausea, cramping, abdominal pain were just some of the bigger side effects. sometimes the stomach pain was so painful it was worse then an actual flare-up. i stopped taking asacol because of the intense stomach pain it caused me as well as the nausea. i found that while taking asacol, my falre-ups did decrease but the side effects outweighed the benefits."

1,"the synthetic thyroid hormone treatment made it so i was at least able to function, sped my metabolism up enough to keep warm and have regular menses. side effects come from taking either too little or too much synthroid. it is a tightrope balancing act and the blood work is not specific enough to guide the clinical course. compared to others who naturally have a functioning thyroid, it is clear to see that synthroid is an inferior product to what the thyroid makes naturally in a healthy individual. i know that i still have minor hypothyroid symptoms even when my blood counts show that i have therapeutic levels of the medication. additionally, generic versions of synthroid seem to be even less effective at relieving all the symptoms, even though the blood counts could be normal. with hypothyroidism becoming a very common condition these days, one would think that new medications would be coming out, but the medical professionals seem content to stick with synthroid because ""on paper"" it seems to be safe and effective."
1,"my miracle drug!! i have suffered for years with extreme mood swings, depression, and bulimia. it was several months ago that i was diagnosed with bipolar -i was immediately prescribed lamictal-i didn't really notice a difference so my dr. upped it to mg. it has worked wonders! i am so proud to say that i am happy and i haven't felt this elation in years! i can actually stay awake during the day, i have the drive to exercise, my labido is back(sure did miss that), almost no mood swings at all and most importantly i feel like a mother again! i have  beautiful little girls that i can hug, kiss, and love again!! i feel like crying-in a good way-everytime i think about how happy i am! my only fear is wondering how long this will last-i can only pray this will last forever. the only side effects i have (i consider  of these not even side effects at all)headaches, staying asleep at night, weird fever like feeling, increase in sexual drive and weight loss. all are tolerable considering the benefits.  mg a day-taken before bedtime"

0,"not noticable, supposed to clear all yeast from body because i had been feeling bloated, kept getting yeast infections and when i had colonics the lady told me that i had an abundance of yeast.  makes sense cuz i drink a lot of beer and don't eat too healthy. none take one tablet, once a day for two weeks.  i was also supposed to eat a lot of yogurt and take a pro biotic pill once and a while.  affects were not noticible and i have no idea whether i really had yeast over growth and whether it did any thing beneficial or not."
1,"treatment began to work after  days. i had not been able to smell for  years and my smell is now restored. increased anxiety maybe not due to flonase, as i suffer with anxiety any way. i tried the drops as my nasal polyps were so big that i was suffering frequent sinus infection. i was advised to take the drops for - weeks before i may see improvement. the drops worked after  days, the nasal polyps shrunk i could breathe with my mouth closed and i could smell and taste again. i am delighted."

0,"the only positive effects was blood pressure moderately controlled. i wanted to switch from atenolol because of concerns it would increase insulin resistance. so my dr. prescribed lisinopril and told me to take it for  weeks to see if it was going to be effective. after  weeks it was effective but i started noticing that gradually when i laid down to sleep at night, it felt like there was lots of mucous in my throat. then the tickle started in my throat which made me feel like gagging. then my voice was affected. it became hoarse and i noticed my throat felt soar. i searched on the internet and read about side effects from ace inhibitors and realized i was being negatively affected by the drug. i stopped the drug, but it has taken over a month to completely overcome the negative side effects. take one  mg per day in the am."

1,"this is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. it is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. it exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. it also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. it smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. you can read about all its benefits on pubmed. it has been proven more effective than tretinoin (retin a) for both acne and photoaging. initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is very important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. do not overdose on tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually create wrinkles rather than eliminate any. if you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. you should probably start using it only every rd or th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. some people are able to use it twice a day; i know i cant. in case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. if you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. you will have to use a lower dose bp such as .% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated. the gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. the cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. i believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. i have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .% and .%. i am currently using the .% cream. there is a generic version available from an indian manufacturer called glenmark. their product is called tazret. it is virtually the same as the original."
1,"i used to have near-daily migraines.  i tried every migraine medication on the market.  either they didn't have any effect, or i was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  with botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, i am virtually migraine-free for months. sometimes i had some minor swelling at an injection site.  it went away within days. my neurologist injects the tiny cranial muscles as well as muscles along my neck and upper shoulder.  he uses a tiny needle and injects very little at each site.  he determines where the trigger points are before administering the botox.  please note:  if using botox for migraines, do go to a neurologist who is experienced with migraine pain.  do not have this done by a cosmetic surgeon!"
1,"opened lungs when breathing was difficult. stimulating--very. i used an asthma inhaler frequently as a child.  i think it was albuterol, although it is hard to be certain.

in my forties, i had a recurrence of asthma.  the pharmacist and my doctor both said not to use the over-the-counter inhalers.  i did try one, and it was much more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.

at some point, i got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the ventolin brand.  my doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.

i rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  but i try to keep one with me at all times because when i need it, i really need it.  i take long walks down and up a hill and if i had an attack at the bottom of the hill i would be in trouble.

it is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and i feel like i am suffocating--then i inhale ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  it is a lifesaver.

as a child and teenager i did not mind the slight ""rush,""  i even liked it.  part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug."
1,"my worst symptom was in my feet. it was painful to walk, and therefore i walked slowly even when i used shoes with good support (birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. there was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. these were my symptoms when i was on methotrexate alone. when i started enbrel, i felt the effects within hours. within the same day i could walk decently with much less pain. within the next few days and weeks, i'm practically back to normal. in my second month, i think i started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and i read about: i felt a faint shadow of the foot pains i used to experience but i can still move normally. none that i can tell i inject myself twice a week in the stomach area, which is a feat because until this happened, i was scared to death of getting injections."
1,"the lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  the neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well i was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for  / months.  these two pain relievers work so very well together.  there is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  i am also on other medication for this as well. being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  i'm not broken, i'm hurt.  i have children at home, i need to at least be mobile! many of the medications i take have a side effect that affects your memory.  my short term memory is terrible.  i can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork, a pen, etc. and can not come up with the word, at all.  i'll be able to later, or the next day, i haven;t forgotten the word, i just can;t get it out of my brain.  the neurontin has also affected my eyes.  i sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes i am able to read the phone book and othertimes i need magnifying glasses.  this all started a week after starting the medicine. i have a torn lumbar disk.  i have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  i have no feeling in my feet.  my right leg does not work correctly.  the neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that i have today.  then the other medications i take all do their part.  the nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  the methodone deals directly with the pain as does the lidoderm patch.  the muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  the anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where i want to be.  i usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  when my last medicine stopped working, i was depressed for a total of  months.  what a waste of time."
1,"i have taken this drug off and on for the past  years. i have always had good results with it, but i wanted to go off it to have children. then, after my last child, i tried to make it without medication, but i realized i couldn't. i am very careful about the medications i take and i don't like being stuck on anything. however, i realized that i needed help and my children needed a happy mommy. i went back on prozac (the generic form)  months ago and now feel better than i have in years. i can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. i can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. i can laugh and enjoy my children. i am truly a new person. i am regretting not going back on this medication sooner. honestly, the only side effect i have had is that it is harder to have an orgasm. i can still have them, but it just takes longer. i don't really feel ""in the mood"" as much, but that is a very small detriment compared to what i was experiencing before. i have had no other side effects whatsoever. i do not even feel ""mediciney"" or out of it at all and no stomach problems, either. i am planning on seeing my doctor every  months and have my blood checked once a year to check my liver, etc., but so far am doing great. i do see a counselor every  weeks, which is invaluable to me."
0,"i am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels. it's kind of strange, as they've only were back in range, when i stopped taking l-thyroxine. sudden and enormous increase in appetite, weight gain, i gained  kg, my belly seemed inflated all the time;

mood swings; l-thyroxine was supposed to increase the low production of thyroid hormones, which was a result of hypothyroidism, as well as to help lower the number of antithyroid antibodies (which indicate the autoimmune disease that may be damaging the thyroid gland).
levothyroxine ( mcg)was taken � minutes before breakfast daily, for almolst  years. the doctor told me, that i should take it as long as i live. however, the levels of thyroid hormones have changed dramatically when i stopped taking l-thyroxine, they were in absolutely normal range, which showed, that i do not need to be on l-thyroxine anymore."

1,"it did lower my blood pressure, although my physician wanted to lower it further because i started out on  mg a day so the medication doseage was raised to  mg which as been more effective at lowering my blood pressure.  even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though i am young. on the  mg dosage i noticed that my throat was itchy and scratchy, causing a lot of cough and some gagging with the cough.  for some reason this problem disappeared when i was switched to the  mg dosage.  at times i get a bit of ringing in my ears but it is not regular.  i do notice fatigue and although i have started taking other medications after starting the lisinopril i think the lisinopril did affect my libido, although not a lot. mostly pleased with lisinopril because it is effective at keeping my blood pressure down.  due to a one time mail in problem with my prescription service i was off the lisinopril for approximately a week and my blood pressure went right back up, and was under control again a few days after starting up.  i keep track of my blood pressure at home and it regularly remains in a very good range of / or so with some variations.  i am hoping not to stay on the drug for long term but since my blood pressure went right back up after a short time of not taking it i'm not sure how short term it may be."
1,"this drug improved my mood greatly. i can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, i would crawl under a rock and cry. a lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but i think it was low enough to where i could have moderate lows and elevated highs. it helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating. i had headaches if i didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. i also have insomnia, however, if you cut your intake of caffeine, it shouldn't be too severe. i took this at noon. it's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day, i feel a bit strange. either way, i know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions. this drug helps me cope and sometimes i feel like i don't need it anymore, but i go right back on it when i feel the blues creeping up on me again."
1,"made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. had tried zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. cycled through a number of other drugs ( within  months) and ended up sticking with effexorxr as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially. weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
attempted to taper off & managed to only go from  to mg for a week before major side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives. returned to mg (for a month now) and still experiencing severe hives & developing allergies to a number of things i wasn't allergic to before. post-natal depression & major depression/anxiety."
1,"this drug turned my severe recurrent depression around. none. this drug changed my life. i have taken every antidepressant in the book. i received some benefit from most of them but my depression always returned and many of them had unpleasant side effects, including weight gain and constipation. this drug helped me enjoy life again. i still have occasional bouts of depression due to life cirsumstances but they are much briefer and less severe. i feel much more outgoing and enjoy being around people more. i no longer want to withdraw from the world and now face the world with much more confidence. for people worried that this drug produces an ""artificial"" feeling of happiness--this is not the case. this is the way people are supposed to feel. you will still have a normal range of moods. i only wish this drug had existed sooner--my whole life would have been differnt."

1,"treatment benefits included prevention of pregnancy, clearer, more manageable skin, reduced menses and significantly reduced cramps. i never had another huge cystic acne after taking this medication. i had very very tiny acne occasionally. i mainly went to the doctor for heavy cramps. now each month i do not suffer from cramps and am very happy. i was warned birth control can cause mood swings, i did not have any significant ones. maybe around the time of my period. also, i gained about  pounds after going on the pill, but lost it eventually by upping my exercise and watching closer what i ate. for some reason, i think it's easier to gain weight on this pill, but i don't know if it's just in my head. when i first got on this birth control, i had an intense craving for eggs and ate eggs  weeks straight. again, i don't know if i'm imagining things but i would lose  pounds during the sugar pill? maybe it's because i'm tired all of the time. i always take the pill at night with lots of water. i am told yasmin increases the amount of potassium and extra water will flush out the excess. this could be a problem because there's been rumors (not confirmed, but rumors) yaz might have to be either modified or off the market because of this, according to my doctor. it's expensive, i'm not going to lie. i pay almost  bucks per month because i have no insurance.  make sure you exercise on this pill, because i really think it makes you sluggish easily so you could gain more weight. i've never tried generic."
1,"although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, accutane really helped my skin. i have tried everything! the benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. on accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for - days. normally i had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. i would never go without a day of washing when i wasn't on accutane. some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if i scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. this time around i had less side effects. the first time on accutane ( years ago when i was  yrs old) i had bad side effects. i was taking too high of a dose in my opinion mg/day. i weighed - lbs. i had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain... first treatment at  years old.  pills a day of mg. with food.  at  years old and  lbs i took only  pill a day that was mg. every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. you must be on birth control because being pregnant and on accutane causes birth defects. taking accutane was the only thing that helped me. although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. the first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. accutane really affects people differently. i was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . in my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug."

1,"valtrex tablets work by stopping the multiplication of the virus which causes herpes. they can reduce the length and severity of an outbreak of herpes, the duration of pain and shorten the time to healing of crusts associated with herpes. valtrex tablets help the blisters to heal more quickly. if you start
taking them as soon as you feel an outbreak starting, you may actually
prevent the blisters from developing. i did not have any ""observable"" or noticeable side effects while taking valtrex.  however, i was forewarned that valtrex has the following side effects:  headache, gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea,constipation, abdominal pain,indigestion).  also because i was taking valtrex to prevent outbreaks triggered by laser treatments, i was advised that valtrex causes sensitivity to uv light and my skin would be much more vulnerable to sunburn even during very short exposure to uv light. i took valtrex before a laser treatment to prevent the outbreak of cold sores or herpes virus.  the first laser treatment without taking valtrex caused a herpes/cold sores breakout on my face around the chin area.  after consulting with my physician, he prescribed valtrex to prevent the outbreaks in future laser treatments.  i learned that the laser triggered the herpes outbreak, since the virus is in a dormant state until it is disturbed and activated by the laser.  i was prescribed  mg of valtrex to be taken  days before the treatment, the day of the treatment and three days after the treatment, for a total of seven days.  i took the medication twice a day and started this seven day regime each and every time i had a laser treatment to prevent any outbreaks."

1,"the ambien did give me a solid nights rest. i did not experience the rapid effect that i've often read about, i.e. that i would fall asleep within  minutes even if i was in the middle of an activity. it usually took about  minutes to take effect. after a while i seemed to notice that i was mildly 'groggy' for several hours after waking up. i was working at a garden center at the time and was frequently forgetting where i had left something. the joke was that i had my own private 'lost and found'. not sure what this means. i was prescribed this drug for insomnia which could have been menopausal related. i took the drug nightly for approximately two years. about half way thru this time i tried to quit but the insomnia returned so i continued. the second time i successfully quite and have not had a problem since that time."

1,"prior to taking this medication, i was feeling very tired and ""fuzzy headed"".  i thought these feelings were just due to being overly busy and getting older.  in an annual check-up it was discovered that my thyroid levels were off.  this medication brought my thyroid level to normal. i noticed increased energy and mental clarity within just a few days of starting the medication. none after finding through a blood test that my thryoid levels were off, my doctor prescibed this medication for me. within just a couple of days, i noticed a marked improvement in my energy level."

1,i had acne constantly and would break out a few time a week.  my breakouts have gotten better and only occur occaisionally. the only side effects i have seen are some dryness on the face. i use the differin gel .% on my face and neck every night.  the differin has helped with the break outs but i do not notice and difference in lines or wrinkles.
0,"my pain would subside for several hours. the drug gave me a sense of euphora which allowed me to deal with the pain better. it gave me a comforting sensation and allowed me to sleep good. my mood changed for the better, almost as if i were high.it actually motivated me to do the things i would normally be too lazy to do. this medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood. i would have mild itching i began taking this medication as prescribed but it put me in such a good mood i began taking more...and needing more. it works great for anxiety also but when i stopped taking it i had the most horrible withdrawls. i could not sleep. my insides felt like they were jumping. i was awfully tired and depressed. i could not keep my arms and legs still when i sat down. it was horrible. i was addicted to this medication and i still am.  i am still trying to wean off of it. i do not recommend this medicine to anyone. especially if you've had an addiction problem with any other pain meds. beware!!!!!!!!"
0,the soma made the patient agitated and did not work. the flexril made the patient relax and sleep enough to let the rib heal nicely. the wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer. no activity for six weeks as patient was a truckdriver for a living and fell in the bathroom at home and broke her rib.  it was floating around and lung puncture was the greatest concern.  the flexril made the patient relax to almost oblivion therefore disabling her ability to move around.  the wellbutrin was for bipolar disorder and was taken twice a day for at least a year and prior to that cymbalta which she said gave her gas.

0,"mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. the symptoms took at least  out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as maxamox. unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits, and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present. swollen glands, especially in breasts. my breasts became enlarged and very painful, causing my doctor to diagnose pregnancy. of course this was not the case, as i tested negative for pregnancy, and my doctor was reluctant to believe that the keflex had anything to do with it. my father noted same side effects after a similar course of keflex. he developed painful and swollen glands in mouth and neck. also, the management of the urti took much longer than with other antibiotics. my symptoms seemed to linger on and on. i had a severe urti with bronchial coughing, headache,  muscular and joint pains, and general feeling of fatigue. my doctor presecribed keflex as an antibiotic, she regarded it as a most effective treatment for this severe urti. i was to take one tablet (i forget the dosage) once a day for a week to ten days. as i was working i had  no time to rest and had to rely on panamax to held suppress the symptoms. unfortunately within a day  my breasts became sore and swollen, and at the end of the week i returned to my gp who tried to diagnose pregnancy when there was not the slightest possibility of this. i finished the course of keflex, only to take on another antibiotic at the end of the course since the keflex did such a poor job."

1,"during the  years so far [out of ], i have had no recurrance of the tumour and no additional tumours have been detected by ultra-sound, mammogram, and twice-yearly check-ups. perhaps the greatest benefit is the gradual reduction in stress experienced as a result of my on-going stabilised condition after a lumpectomy. i had some initial swelling of my hip, knee and ankle joints in the morning which slowly subsided during the day. the medication also aggravated the hot-flushes of the menopause, making them initially frequent and copious, and on-going for the treatment duration so far - tho with reduced frequency now in year . i also experience considerable thirst. i was put on aromasin after  months on tamoxifen because i suffered debilitating muscle cramps on tamoxifen as well as joint problems and extreme hot flushes. aromasin has been kinder, and so far i have taken it daily for  years out of an initial . it may be prescribed beyond  years, i'm not sure. it has relatively slight side effects now but in the first  months i was conscious of its effects on my body - not intolerable by any means, just noticable."

1,cleared up acne with first treatment. very very dry skin. lips were chaped and nose was dry. eyes were a little dry as well. i was / years when i was on accutane. it's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. i tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. it was a savior!! i definitely didn't get depression. if anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. i would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. i still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say i have acne. i highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. it was the only thing that worked for me!

1,"ortho tri cyclen effectively prevented pregnancy, cleared up acne, gave me regular periods, helped with iron deficiency due to blood loss thinning hair, bleeding gums, eventually the iron deficiency came back i began taking ortho tri cyclen at age .  it gave me regular periods (they aren't really 'periods,' they are just a withdrawl from the hormones) and less cramping, lighter flow.  it got rid of my acne. i did not get pregnant in my . years of taking the drug.  i think that eventually the pill prevents you from absorbing nutrients because my iron deficiency came back. i am not sure if the nutrient absorption has anything to do with having bleeding gums more often, but i did have a lot of pain because of a dislodged clot when i got my wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon said that this happens more often to women who take birth control. i stopped taking the pill to find more natural ways of birth control, and because my hair was becoming thin and brittle. i also don't like the stories of the effect hormones are having on our environment (going into groundwater)."

1,"blackheads are gone. pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. acne scars faded. skin looks more polished. a few days a week, my face would be red, very sensitive, and peeling. then it would be back to normal and then a few days later the peeling starts again. i use this drug to help with the overall appearance of my skin, especially blackheads, pore size, and acne scars. i don't have any wrinkles, so i can't comment on how well it worked for that. but hopefully it is preventing wrinkles from ever developing. i only use it twice a week now coz my skin is very sensitive. once i get more used to the drug, i will slowly increase the frequency. during the first two weeks of use, i didn't really notice any changes except that my skin was drier and started to peel a little. by the third week, i started seeing my blackheads disappearing and my pores changing. they actually looked bigger. then after  months of continued usage, my pores got smaller, acne scars faded and blackheads are almost completely gone. few days a week i would have red, irritated peeling skin. but nothing extremley terrible or intolerable. with good moisturizer and calming face creams, i'm able to minimize my peeling to a point where it doesn't bother me that much. i've heard that retin-a takes awhile to work and see results, but i've already seen positive changes in less than  months. i can't wait to find out the long-term benefits it will have on my skin, especially after i start increasing the frequency and concentration."

. bad experience for $!!! hi! i am a russian (european race) who has migrated from sweden to the usa. i have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. i visited a dermatologist in the usa, fl about  month ago. he prescribed me tri luma that contains % of hudroquinone. have you ever read about hydroquinone?- i asked him. as i investigated it i found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including france, sweden and russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.the fda admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.in fact, the fda also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. anyway,i tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. he prescribed to use it twice a week - mondays and fridays. it was terrible!!! i used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after  week it was peeling. some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! i put it on only once a week. ok, after  month,  treatments i have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. moreover, the skin is burnt and now i have very obvious dark red-brown spots. i really look terrible. i can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by tri luma. i am so happy that i didn't buy the full size cream which costs $ and the insurance doesn't cover it. i don't want to buy cancer for $. thanks. i've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. they've forbade to use it strongly!!! they've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the sun. please be aware, read more information online."
0,"my cough was reduced, from  hours a day, to a few episodes per day first, what i termed ""cipro brain"", which is not thiking clearly and making mistakes (like jet-lag).  then, i started getting ulcers on my tongue.  they spread to my gums and inside lips and my tongue was swollen, making it difficult to talk.  i was afraid that if i got stopped, driving, the cop would think i was drunk, because i was slurring my words.  now, several days after stopping the drug, i still have extreme fatigue. i'm hoping to return to normal!  when i had pneumonia, i actually felt fine, but the cough had to to be treated.  i doubt if i would ever take ciprofloxacin again. i took the pill twice a day, morning and evening, after meals.  i also kept up with my daily exercise regimen (walking and swimming)."

1,"the effexor worked the first day i took it.  for some time previously, i had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  the day i began taking it, i noticed a difference in that i felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering  children full-time. as i said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next  weeks until i worked up to my eventual dose (i started at  mg. and worked my way up to  mg.). the only side effect i noticed was that if, for some reason, i forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening i felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way. i'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  i will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, i will be happy to help.  i was seeing a psychiatrist  years ago who thought effexor was worth a try.  i had been on prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years i developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  that was the reason i discontinued the use of prozac. after being off the prozac or any other meds for a year or two, i could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  i found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on effexor.  it was a miracle.  i was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (several years before, i had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when i first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work and not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) my treatment consisted of: taking the  mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. although i could notice a marked difference in my mood, i still felt that i wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as i needed to be.  i would still have days when i felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  when i discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that i add luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  that helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: ) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and ) night sweats.  my doc prescribed  mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended  mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  it may have helped a little, but i was never quite sure. one other thing i found beneficial for my anxiety was  mg. dexadrine.  it seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day i took it, i felt calm for the first time in my life. up until then i didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because i had never known what it was like to be without it. but that very first day i took it, i felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  always before, i had a feeling inside that i can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  sort of like, ""i'm late! gotta hurry! oh, no!""  that was a feeling that i had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  for the first two weeks i took the dexadrine, i didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did i even realize i wasn't pulling, as i didn't even think about it.  unfortunately, i did go back to pulling after that. the  side effects i experienced with the dex. is that ) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after i took it, and ) it made me feel like i lost my spontaneity.  i got a lot more done, and i didn't feel so panicked, but i wasn't as much fun.  for that reason, i stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  after maybe a year or two i quit taking it altogether and when i went back on it last year after having been off of it for about  years, it no longer worked as it had before.  it made me feel jittery as though i'd had way too much coffee.  it just made the anxiety worse.

i'm not sure if i was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. however, these four meds i've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so. i have taken a myriad of other anti-depressants in my quest to find one that would work, and i would be willing to share my experiences with those other meds as well. just let me know if you want mori info."

1,"i had gotten severe age spots on my hands, probably from spending many years driving long distances each day.  my hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  my hands now looks pretty good/very good! as the age spots scabbed up, they peeled off, and left my hands red, raw and sore.  one night, the burning feeling was so intense, i had to wash it off.  i was quite worried, as this medicine was out of date, and i thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne, but i had read online that it might be helpful for age spots. i applied a small amount, probably more than i needed to, to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  before many nights had passed, i noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  before long, the age spots just seemed to peel off, as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.  although i was concerned that i had severly burned and scarred my hands (they looked very bad for more than a month), now they look great.  in fact, the left one, which was the worse one, improved more than the right hand!"

1,"i began suffering from ""heartburn"" in my late thirties. this condition progressed to a daily occurence. not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. i recall he intially prescribed mg twice daily. at one point he recommended mg twice aday. but mg twice daily is working. the dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero. i am not aware of any side effects. however that does not mean i have not experienced any. i think headaches are a side effect and i get them occasionally, but i cannot tie it to the medication. in any case i do not experience any kind of debilitating medical problems or even annoying ones that i can link to taking ranitidine. i take a mg tablet in the morning before or during breakfast and then another at lunch. this combination prevents heartburn throughout the day. late night dinners may produce heartburn, often i'll take a tablet prior or immediately after as prevention. also i elevated my bed about "" at the head to prevent what had been fairly frequent events of stomach acid somehow working its way into my mouth at night. this drug and the elevated bed has reduced this to a very rare occurence, and again often associated with late evening meals if i do not take a tablet in the evening."

mild dry mouth; solved by drinking more water i was started on a low dose, which cleared my acne in a couple of months but my doctor then had me repeat another  month session to make sure the clearing of my skin was permanent.

i know there has been a great deal of controversy about this drug and its side effects.  but for me, it is the one medicine that i have taken that made an enormous difference in my life."
1,"after  years of treating hypothydoidism with  mgr dose, the patient was able to lower the dose to  mgr per day. thyroid levels are now normal. no side effects have been observed so far. started  years ago with a  mgr dose and after  years of daily use changed to  mgr due to a positive effect of the drug. besides taking levothyroxine, the patient is also practicing yoga exercises that stimulate thyroid gland."
1,"very effective in obtaining a mild peel, to slough off dead skin cells, every  days or so. using it for more than  days at a stretch caused excessive peeling, which was visible even under makeup. redness and rawness was also present. a break of a few days was required before restarting the treatment. tazarotene cream was applied to the face at bedtime and washed off in the morning"
0,i did not find any benefit really.  in fact it seemed to make me more anxious. anxiety i was prescribed this because of anxiety and mild depression by my gp but it did not improve my condition and seemed to make my anxiety worse.  my anxiety was partly due to my personality and partly due to the fact that i had a mentally ill son which caused me a lot of worry and stress.   my gp thought that ssri's may help and prescribed fluoxetine.   this did not help and he changed me to cipramil which suited me better as it did not make my anxiety worse but it did not really help my anxiety that much so i stopped taking this as well.
0,"at first it kept my symptons to a minimum, and mood in general inhanced. this for almost a full year....then i needed to up dosage first went to  weeks...then to every weeks...dose increased to max of mg at first all good--felt wonderful mood and physical some itching on chest area and coughing for  days after dose 
then started breaking out in sores when in sun...they would not heal face, ears and  scalp hair loss at sore site especially in scalp which has remained somewhat permanent.  soon no longer getting physical relief from ra symptons...stopped treatment as relief became less than side effects
i really wish this particular drug would have worked for me...or orencia which had a less time consuming and less frequent rate of ivs!

also--finding a vein became difficult at times and collapsed veins were not uncommon in group ivs

only once during iv process i became horribly nauseous and they became quite concerned about convulsions they slowed the drip and i made it thru that after that they kept a crash cart nearby in case of and i never had another reaction like that ---contributed it to lack of sleep, food and pain degree i was having remicade is an iv drug administered over a  hour period. usually a group of - patients are scheduled in slightly staggered--lunch is given if time goes over lunch time, water encouraged during after and before for hydration....a steriod, saline and antihystemine are also administered-steriod,saline by iv and anithyst by mouth...blood pressure and temp are checked periodically  dosage is by weight or minimum amounts, a saline is then flushed thru tubbing to hydrate and to fluch out any meds left in tube
i am now waiting for a drug to become avaiable that does not require a second line drug such as methotrexciate(sp) or sulfasalizine as i have had reactions to both these but studies with newest drugs require a second line drug and until they become available to general public i have to wait---also with the drug scares that have happened bextra etc (still have scarring from that one on arms from severe sun burn) things seem to be taking longer to come out"
1,"after a copule of days i started to feel a little better. i did not feel as much tension in my stomach, and the pain started to go away. i have been using it everytime i feel pain in my stomach. i did not have heart burn though. it was only treated for pain/ulcer purposes. none. i did not feel any side effects whatsoever.the only thing is that it does not work inmediately like other pills. it takes several days for the pill to start working, but it does do the job. it took several days for the medication to start working, but once it did i felt better. i have to take one pill everyday with food for  weeks."
1,"ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss. while the initial male pattern baldness is mild, i fear worsening of the condition, and am taking this as a preventive measure. i experienced sharp bursts of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy-two hours of commencing treatment. these subsided and may or may not be related to the medication. i began taking the product to stave off the onset of male pattern baldness. as the treatment is said to show full effects in two years, my four-week course is probably not enough to show results. i will report again in due time."
1,this drug kept my sugar down constantly to where it should be finally.i am very satisfied with it so far. mild nausea and occasional diarrhea but it should stop within the next week or two. i take byetta  x daily before lunch and dinner.after i eat i take my metformin and my amaryl.this works great for me.the doctor is trying to help me loose weight and get off the amaryl.
1,"the prescription recommended that i use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  i alternate one night of retin-a,  night of stri-vectin.  the retin-a causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that i don't look as if my face has dandruff.  i use a clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  i have also used benefit's ""bluff dust"" to cover the redness that the retin-a gel causes, and continue to use noritate for my rosacea.  the retin-a is very effective, but also quite expensive.  i have found a pharmacy in canada where i can order it online for less than % the us price.  i hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  i have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because i am a committed scowler.  i do not believe that retin-a would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience. some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when i started writing a response to the first question, i didn't see what was to follow.  the retin-a gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  for this reason, i used it every other day instead of every day. i alternate with stri-vectin.  i also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
when exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  i have used benefit cosmetics' ""bluff puff"" to tone down the redness; i have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  however, my complexion looks great without makeup.  i still use mascara and liner and shadow. before going to bed, i wash my face with the clarisonic brush.  i love it!
when my face is clean and dry, i apply a pea-sized amount of retin-a gel all over my face and neck.  i do not avoid the eye area, but i do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  i also put talika lipocils on my eyelashes.  
in the morning i wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  then i moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  this does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
the following night i wash my face and when it is clean and dry, i apply stri-vectin.  i alternate so that one night i use retin-a and the next night i use stri-vectin or another moisturizer.  i don't think i will be buying any more stri-vectin because i am doubtful of its effectiveness and because i would prefer to make my own product.  i know that i will be unable to make retin-a gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me."
1,"my skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when i had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  a day after i started taking the medication, i noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  i was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  my doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how i did with the cephalexin alone.  i continued to heal faster than i think i would have without the medication. i had no side effects take  capsule three times per day for  days."
1,"i was living with pain in most of the major muscle groups of my body.  it had gotten to the point of having to have help to get out of bed.  when there was a flare-up i had to go to bed. tramadol hcl combined with cymbalata reduced my pain by about %!  made my life livable again.  i'm thankful that i hung in through the side effects of cymbalata.  it took over a year to find the right combination of drugs and i'm thankful that finally did. cymbalata side effects:  vivid non-stop dreams for about a year, and slight nausea and sleepiness for several weeks.  the excess dreaming finally stopped and the combination of the  drugs has been working miracles for me ever since.  most people give up on cymbalta but i was desparate.  most of the side effects do go away as i said in about  weeks except for the dreaming. no details really, just take pills as prescribed, tramadol  a day and cymbalata  a day. i can add a tramadol if i am having a flareup.  i'm leading a pretty normal life.  i don't have as much energy as i would like but i sure have a lot less pain."
0,"there was little to no benefit from taking the medication. acne did not visibly improve over the entire course of medication. side effects included constipation. the treatment consisted of taking minocycline for  months everyday x/day. it was taken with after dinner with a full glass of water. the pills were not large, and easy to swallow."
1,"improved breathing, less frequent asthma attacks and the ability to run either outside or inside, depending on the season no side effects really.  despite it all, i still had some difficulty depending on the season.  when cedar is really high, i still suffered asthma related problems even though i was taking the drug regularly. advair is an inhaled power that you take twice a day.  it's composed of two ""active ingredient"" - a long acting bronchio dilator and a steroid - both aid in combating asthma."

1,"i have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. i had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). i was told i was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. so i was warned to take all of these or i'd be back later for iv treatment and it would be a far longer course. well, i took  of the  days prescribed and not only did i never get an infection, i had few side effects. there was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what i standardly use -- yogurt. i'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement. slight nausea - hardly noticeable i took the doxycycline for  of the ten days prescribed, taking two pills per day."
0,"the treatment benefits were smoking cessation, first a gradual reduction - a day then - a day  then i quit for  weeks i experienced depression and severe anxiety. i had multiple strange dreams with physical sexual responses and my sleep patterns were disrupted frequently waking up in the  middle of the night unable to go back to sleep, sexual dysfunction  a day"

0,"there were no benefits as he had to stop taking it brownish colored urine, nausea and vomiting, stomache ache patient was to take  mg twice daily to treat ulcerative colitis but was found to be intolerant to asacol and was discontinued. the side effects began about - days after starting the asacol. the nausea and vomiting was not immediately associated with asacol but was attributed to possibly having the flu.  it was only until his urine became a brownish purple color that we thought it must be the asacol and immediately stopped it.  symptoms went away when stopped."
1,"immediate relielf from anxiety.....even better after a couple of weeks.  may focus is better on this drug than all the years (about ) i have been treated for add. none as long as you don't miss any doses.  missing more than one dose results in vertigo.  i'm sure there are very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it. i was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder in my early 's.  i tried different treatments...ritalin (terrible side effects), adderall (didn't work well alone), adderall with effexor (worked great but is hell on your sex life) and then adderall with wellbutrin.  i took the adderall with welbutrin for  years but had to take ambien to sleep. heart palpatations are another side effect of that combo.  

menepause hit a couple of years ago and nothing seemed to work well and i developed major anxiety issues.  i started on estrogen replacement and then asked my dr what we could try that was closer to the effexor i tried years ago.  that's when we tried pristiq.  he seemed amazed at the results.  i do not need a ""drug cocktail"" anymore....i felt like elvis for years.  i love my life again!"

1,"i woke up with a more relaxed jaw. i have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. so if i have alot of tension in my jaw before i go to bed i will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. taking cyclobenzaprine(flexeril) before i go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to bruxism. i have only had one side effect due to mixing cyclobenzaprine(flexeril) with maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness. it has been only  week of taking cyclobenzaprine so i may experience different side effects the more i take it. so far this medication has worked for me. i did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this  week. i started this medication around the same time i start to get pms symptoms ""mainly very moody and argumentative"" and i'm amazed how cyclobenzaprine effected my pms symptoms. i have absolutely been the most pleasant person to be around.  it feels great to be myself and not angry at everything."
1,my blood pressure was out of control. my doctors had prescribed diuretics (limited effectiveness) and other forms of calcium channel blockers. this in my opinion is a wonder drug!my blood pressure had shot up so badly that i would get nosebleeds when working on my knees or bending over.my pressure was in the triple digits at times. none whatsoever once daily generally in the morning with a light breakfast
0,"having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last  years (all of the ssri category) or so, and i can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over. it almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my  and  points respectively (up to about /), as well as elevating my heart rate from  beats per minute to - beats. i occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (i'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit). the benefits of effexor xr were terrific. the side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. that said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. i would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. let me put this into perspective: i've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the effexor was the worst (and i required hospitalization for the alcohol). it took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. i tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at % the regular dose, then %, and then % before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small i had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. even finally quitting taking the drug at all when i'd tapered down to /th the initial dose, i experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what i've read in effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of  mg. if i were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it, even with the withdrawal. otherwise, i'm staying away from ssnri's for a long time."
1,"fell asleep fast, woke up withouut significant fatique. mild grogginess for a short time subsided within one hour of waking. i encountered no physical side effects, however i did have trouble with insomnia after i discontinued the treatment. it was more difficult to fall asleep after discontinuation than before treatment began. i consider this to be a mark of addiction. dosage taken at bedtime caused extreme tiredness. slept through the night, woke in the morning without unusual grogginess, but the treatment was somewhat addictive, i thought."
1,"improved sleep considerably, relieved muscle pain, calmed anxiety, stabilized mood swings. initially i had a bit of nausea and extreme sleepiness the first week, but then that subsided and everything was great for a month. after that i began to experience itchy skin, but not enough to be bothered by it. soon after that i then broke out in hives all over my body in the middle of the night several nights in a row. the itching was unbearable and i had to switch to a different medication. i took one dose a couple hours before bed each night. i also have regular therapy, yoga practice, daily exercise and healthy diet."

1,"as a former drug addict, i flat refused anything that would be addictive. ie diazepam, tamazepam, etc. my doctor suggested buspar as it was not addictive, and yet had similar effects to diazepam. he prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. however, within  minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me. one dose lasted about  hours, and did not inhibit any other aspect of my day to day activites. it also helped with my disrupted sleep patterns. dry mouth after taking, and slight feelings of lethargy, but hardly noticeable. its meant to be used as a short term treatment for anxiety, no more than  months. but my gp said i can take it using a three month on, three month off rotation. works for me."

0,"it helped relieve anxiety because it made me sleep.  i found that prior to taking this medication, i could not sleep and that i was not eating properly.  my overall health was suffering. it made me so sleepy and sluggish that i could not function properly the next day.  while it did resolve sleep issues, it led to many other issues. moderate anxiety."
1,"got rid of fine lines around my eyes. it also improved my overall complexion. minimized line between my eyebrows. if i used to much, i'd get redness and irritation. with too much, i'd start peeling and face would feel raw and itchy. use every other day a pea sized amt to entire face. don't use more than this or you'll get peeling, redness and irritation."
0,"i believe the treatment at the lower  mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. i also believe i was thinking more clearly afterwards than i was prior to starting on lovastatin. a brain mri taken a year after starting on lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous mri had been lost when i changed doctors. after increasing the dosage to  mgs to also reduce my cholesterol levels, i started to experience extreme pain in my arm muscles. originally i started taking it to see if it would have any positive effect on the number and size of brain lesions i had. i had experienced an increasing inability to handle job stress, was losing my concentration abilities and was becoming increasingly forgetful. i believe it did have some positive effect in reducing the size and number of brain lesions, but not to the effect of improving my cognitive thinking ability to the extent i could return to work. two years later, my doctor wanted me to increase the dosage to reduce my cholesterol levels.  shortly after increasing my dosage, i started to experience chronic pain in my arms.  i finally did some research and discovered muscle pain to be a ""side effect"" when taking statin drugs.  when i stopped taking lovastatin, the pain went away after a few months."
0,"as a caregiver, i did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia the side effects of this medication in combination with the patient's medical condition and current medications were tremendous and in my opinion contributed to the patient's death.  the patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  the patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and i believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  the family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred, the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  it was more than  minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the er for treatment.  the patient was pronounced dead on the scene. the patient was referred to the psychiatrist by his cardiologist secondary to depression and increasing insomnia.  the patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  the psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  slowly the family started noticing strange behavior, delusions, and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a  month period and began to get more severe.  the family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  the forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  the family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death, the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  the family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.  we do not plan to seek legal retribution but hope that anyone that reads this will be more cautious about prescribing seroquel in someone that already has cardiac problems and to please be careful about it's possible interactions with other medications!"
0,"there were no known benefits. i truly believed that the doctor that prescribed me this stupid medication should rot in hell. there are too many side effects, especially long term ones. 

the worst part is, they did not even tell me how and why their diagnosis was accurate. they just prescribe drugs left and right as if they had no conscience or they are evil people just out for the money. memory loss, heart diseasse, increased panick attacks, curbed thinking, loss of sex drive, increased paranoia, increased suicidal thoughts, increase in depression, anxiety. decreased mental capacities. i was put on . mg of this damned drug."

0,"ability to sleep  full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  no need to get up during night to void, also fantastic. excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others. initial mg was taken for only  days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in am.  found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  my morphine controlled release wears off within - hours, so staying in bed not advisable without another dose of morphine or percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  when i finally do wake up, minimally after  hours after i fell asleep, i still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on l side of body.  because of the sleepiness side effect, i do not take any during day. since my md would not lower dosage from mg until next monthly visit, i bought empty size  gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the mg capsules into  mg capsules.  initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  i was able to continue having h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after h was easier.   but, after only  days at the lower mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after h of normal sleep continued, so i need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in am, and once that wore off after  hours in early evening, i am too tired to study for my classes.  overall, i would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  i am hoping the upcoming rfa procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what i learn in class (especially short term memory)."
1,"better t scores after  years feeling a little ""creaky"" the day of treatment you must take this with alot of water first thing in the morning on the same day of the week. you need to sit or stand for an hour after taking the pill and wait that long until eating anything"
1,"when the antidepressant finally kicked in (after about two weeks), i finally felt ""normal.""  it made me realize how down i was.  i've heard other people say the same thing about feeling ""normal.""  i would still get down but it wouldn't last for days.  i could get through it like a healthy-minded person.  it was such a relief from what i had been feeling.  i told myself that i would take it forever if i had to......anything to not feel what i had been feeling for years:  depressed that i'm not good enough. in the past few years i've tried to get off of it by reducing my dose.  i cut my pills in half (to  mg) and after a few weeks went through a depression that really sucked.  but i got through it.  when i tried to take it down to  mg, i got really depressed again and it wouldn't go away.  i went back up to mg and am still there. when i try again to cut back on the dose, i think i'll go to a psychiatrist while doing it.  regular physicians who refill my prescription don't know me and don't know how to offer advice about doing this.

my treatment details....i take it every day.
sometimes i've forgotten a day or have run out of a prescription and didn't get it refilled for a few days.  i got a bit light headed.  definitely not something you can quit cold turkey."
1,the prescription was given for anxiety and to help with sleep during long flights and when under high anxiety situations. lorazepam helped to calm and induced drowziness. i would not recomend this if you have to stay alert as it can make functioning dificult. none to be taken when needed to relieve stress and assist in sleeping.
0,"stop the pain i got terrible rash all over my body, specially arms, nech, face. it was terribly itching and redness, and i haven�t notice it was because of the voltaren taking. i just realized that when i double check the insert with the drug details... i was like a week to eliminate it from my body and have to take another prescription for the rash, an anthistaminic or antialergic. just take the pills every  hours to tame the pain because of the root canal procedure that was done partially, not totally because of the inflamatory process."
1,actually the amitriptyline greatly helped with getting to sleep each night as an added benefit. it is an antidepressant but used in this case to break a cycle of tension headaches. the pattern of tension headaches was broken and the headaches have not since returned. it also acted as a migraine headache preventative. it does cause drowsiness and so had to be taken at night. it also causes a dry mouth. it felt to me as if it were also slowing my metabolism down but this was not measurable in the time frame. one tablet per night for three months.
1,"no hot flashes, increased libido, increased energy level, seemed to feel more zestful.  prilosec controlled acid reflux well didn't notice any side effects, i think it can increase risk of breast cancer, and it can actually help to decrease chance of alzheimer's i have been able to stop taking to prilosec since i have lost weight.  i only take it as needed now, maybe a couple times a week.  i am currently still taking the estratest for hot flashes and it is working well."

0,"i took this drug for pain relief due to surgery (laproscopically assisted hysterectomy). although the pain i experienced wasn't great the drug did relieve it but the side effects were not worth it. it's hard to know as i was swollen from the surgery but the drug's listed side effects are swelling if the torso, thighs, and legs. i was very swollen when i left the hospital and it didn't dissapate. i was given the drug intravenously while in the hospital and a perscription when i went home. i was swollen from my breasts to my toes and attributed this to the surgery.i had told my doctor that i couldn't tolerate a high does of ibuprofen so she prescribed the generic toradol as pain relief. when the swelling showed no signs of abating, i looked up the drug's side effects and saw that swelling of the torso, thighs and legs was listed. i was trying to reduce the swelling so i stopped taking it and switched to  ibuprofen  times a day. that relieved the pain and the swelling immediately started to go down. when i told my doctor she said swelling of the torso was not a normal effect of the surgery. i conclude that the drug was at fault."

0,"moderate reduction in alergy symptoms an intollerable level of sedation. even though i took the medication before bedtime, the next day i felt exhausted and mentally dull for the entire day. given the moderate level of symptom relief, this was not a reasonable trade-off. was instructed to take medication at bedtime to reduce sedating effects."
1,"prevented pregnancy & acne i started taking birth control because it was a month before prom and i was scheduled to have my period then and i would have had it when i was going on a trip to florida, which i was not having. my doctor told me i would probably still get my period around those times, just very light. however i did not get any spotting for three months, i got my period a week ago and it's getting worse. the cramps on a scale of  to  are at , and it went from very light to heavy. i'm not even at the end of the pack yet! i don't recommend seasonique. i was told to take motrin, that hasn't even helped. i've felt like i'm in labor for a week now. i was actually rushed to the hospital last night because the cramps were so severe. all day i felt a little pain now and then, however towards the end of the day it got unbearable. i was sitting in the air conditioning and i started to feel really hot out of nowhere, had difficulty breathing, nausea, and felt like i was literally about to faint. i'm going to try to get off this pill and try something else as soon as i can!"

0,"did stop the sniffles and clear the nasal passages.  headaches were still a problem.  however, coupling this product with aspirin provided a good solution. did cause some drowsiness.  alcohol did intensify this experience.  no reported upset stomach, as is the case with some of these products. treatment regimen was  mg pill per day.  did not need to take with food."

1,"the benefits of this treatment were as i had hoped. i had developed some facial hair over the past few years and grew tired of tweezing and waxing. the treatment took a few months to work, but over time has minimized the hair growth. i will continue to use this as it is a very simple once a day application. none apply cream once daily to effected areas."
0,"taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  i was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before i didn't have any situations i considered safe.  it helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  i got pregnant while taking it (i had been trying for  years) and i honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as i had had four miscarraiges previously.  i started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though i have become housebound.  i feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life. the rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  however after taking it for a few years and feeling i no longer needed it, i found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  i have cut the dosage down considerably, from  mg at night to one, then i became nervous again and started taking  again.  i have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  i would always go back on it.  i never felt i needed more...i just coudn't stop taking even a small amount. i was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  as rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  i was prescribed it for this reason.  i am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

i feel that it did the job, but had i known i would be on it for the rest of my life i'm not sure i would have started taking it.  but maybe if i was desperate like i was then i would.  i was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  she did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after i stopped breast feeding her.  no one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  only for epileptics for life.  she is  now and perfectly normal.  however i do feel guilty about having put her through that."
1,"since i was very young, a child, i suffered debilatating headaches.  often they became true migraines.  they would last for days and days, sometimes weeks
without stop.  i missed school, parties, holidays.  i was scared to make plans
to do anything fearing the pain.  i pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  i had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  sometime late in  i went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  she told me her doctor had put her on elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  i went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for elavil. two weeks later i started going whole days
without head pain.  i went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  i looked
forward to doing things.  i woke up without pain.  what a miracle!  i have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  when
i do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  needless to say my entire life changed. i am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  i take the generic and notice no difference from
elavil.  thank you elavil. none that i noticed. i take one  mg tablet of generic elavil at bedtime."

0,"the femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. this allows you freedom for the next three months, () days until your reorder a new ring.  also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments. the bad thing about this certain dosage of the femring was on the third day it seemed as though i was beginning to have vaginal irritation.  the fourth day was obvious vaginal irritation with a blistery rash.  upon feeling and seeing this rash i removed the femring and called my dr. a lower dose femring was prescribed, .mg/day, which does a good job of returning my horomones levels to close to normal."

1,"i feel much better and this is only the second day on the medication. when the prednisone is in my system it feels like i am almost completely better. once it wears off (before my next day) i am still sick but better than the day before. some side effects for me are wide awake, hyper, jittery, plugged ears (needs to be popped) joint pain and discomfort in my knees, ankles, and hips (almost like an arthritis feeling but not sore, just awkward. before i started on the prednisone i was sick for  weeks with a viral infection the chest (chest) my wheezing was really bad and i was prescribed to symbicort corticosteroid inhaler twice per day to help with the inflammation and airways. after a few days i was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer, and my overall infection was getting worse. i went back to the doctor and they added in a ventolin puffer to open the airways  puffs  times per day in between the symbicort.  days later i went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. he told me i caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. he then prescribed me to  mg of prednisone each day for a  day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) he said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. i took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for  hours or so but gave me some joint pain. the next day i felt a little better but still coughing and sick until i took the prednisone again. (today at :pm) it is now :pm and i am flighing high (thats probably why i am writing in a blog and feel awesome, i feel like i could run a marathon. i also just drank a coffee and i don't think it helped. no coughing. hopefully i can sleep tonight.. i used to take ritalin for add and this kind of feels like that. i think tomorrow i will feel a little better, great again when i am on the prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will finnish off fixing the inflammation. did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. i checked online and all i could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. overall i think it works great!"

1,"after adjusting to the medication, focus and alertness improved significantly.  fatigue and trouble ""becoming bored"" disappeared and i was ablve to focus on school studies and work for the first time in many many years.  no stimulant effect was felt, but it even became fun to actually sit down on a couch and just read a book. mild headaches occasionally when the drug wore off; smelly urine; occasionally insomnia, depending on what time the drug was first taken. have tried ritalin for add and while it worked the stimulant effect was disturbing and way too much.  wellbutrin seemed to not do a thing, but after  week of taking provigil the effect was enourmously obvious."

1,"i'm  taking better care of myself and my appearance. i'm interacting with people and don't feel so detached from others. i'm starting to look forward to things again after feeling numb for so long.
minimal side effects and only lasted a few days. i couldn't tolerate any other anti-d's that i tried because of side effects. minimal but after  days i felt nauseas, queezy, fatigued and a bit 'out of it' and numb/detached.
the nausea only lasted a week but the fatigue hung around for a while. now it's lifting thankfully.
no weight changes at all. i was skeptical that depression even existed so delayed my psych's advice in taking it for a year.
 got to the point i felt so bad i admitted i had a problem and began a small dose of / tablet once a day.

my appetite is normal again after having none for months. the only weight i put on is what i lost and that's because i'm feeling better and have my appetite back. still underweight but i'm on the way to being healthy again.
i feel more alive and positive. i don't feel so withdrawn, guilty and ashamed for no reason. it's not a miracle pill and you have to do the work to get there but lexapro is helping me to 'get there'. i'll take it for as long as i need to. find a good dr and please listen to them and take it if you need to. don't live in misery because of the stigma society sometimes puts on mental health issues. screw society and put your mental health first!"

1,"initially weightloss of  stone and an increase in energy and confidence. after stopping the drug there was a gradual weight gain of lbs until weight settled and has been maintained for  years. health has improved and an increase in fitness and regular exercise has been maintained.benefits have outwayed the side effects as all other attempts over the years to lose weight had failed, and there is a family history of heart disease. side effects at the time included worsened insomnia and irregular menstruation ( already suffered from before starting drug, but worse while taking it) and mood swings. insomnia and irregular menstruation have continued, mood swings have improved but both continued conditions may have worsened naturally anyway due to naturally occurring early peri-menopause as there is a family history of this. drug dosage reccomendations were not followed, and only taken in the morning as this lessened the side effects."
1,seemed to take effect after the first dose. i noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. i was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. i was having all kinds of muscle twitches so i went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. i am a mother and a wife and i was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad i did.. i am only a week into it so i guess time will tell. but so far i am happy with the results. slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. a bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable. i am to meet up with my doctor again after  weeks to see how it is affecting me. i am taking mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. i have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. i don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like i want to better myself so in the end i am hoping that this is just a bandaid until i heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.
0,"while on the drug, i experienced some level of mood stabilization, marked by a greater ability to 'flow with' daily stress. about six weeks ago, i noticed that my hair -- which has been quite thick throughout my life -- was markedly thinner.  my scalp is patchy in spots and the hair is beginning to thin out in clumps on the top of my head. i am, under the direction of my doctor, reducing dosage in  mg increments and taking several vitamin/mineral combinations, including copper, zinc, biotin, and selenium.  but there is no assurance that my hair loss will ever reverse itself -- in fact, it may continue."

1,"i have a great reduction in stomach acid problems. when i've tried to use natural products like alo vera juice or licorice-based products, to take care of the problem, it is very difficult, and i have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. so taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day, though i often begin to get some acid in the evening. as far as i can tell, there are no side effects. i have heard things about these proton inhibitors doing something to the bones, though, making for bone problems, but there's no way i can tell whether it's happening to me. my bone situation has actually improved while on this medication because i've been working out in the gym with weights. the simplicity is one of the best features. i take the pill with a glass of water first thing in the morning, wait at least / an hour before eating anything, and i'm done!"

0,i was perscribed this after i decided to quite narcotic pain killers.  i was taking fairly large doses of oxycotin and switched to voltaren mg.  they will not touch my pain.  i guess i have a high tolerance for pain meds.  i don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain. upset stomach. i was perscribed mgs x  per day.  i take double that amount and still have very little relief.
1,being able to sleep/decrease anxiety surrounding  getting to sleep and staying asleep. also taken during times of high anxiety. helped to control anger outbursts and uncontrolled anxiety. sometimes a hangover effect in the morning if i took it late in the evening and had to get up early. need about  hours to have it leave the system. take as needed for anxiety when going to bed/sleep. i have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep and this medication seemed to take the edge off of my anxiety so that i could fall asleep and then stay asleep. or at least get back to sleep and not feel startled.
1,"i had been on many different treatments for depression throughout most of my adult life and the side effects seamed to outweigh the benefits.  since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  on my last medication i was going to sleep at  p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now i sleep - hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  i had a  lb weight loss in the beginning that i have maintained.  over all i feel i am managing my depression better than i have at any time in the past. side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently i have been having trouble concentrating, my memory has been poor.  generally i feel like my iq has dropped  i have also been very teary and find myself crying a fair amount over small incidences almost like i was pregnant.  none of this may have anything to do with the medication but i am concerned. i went up to mg once a day but cut back to mg a day about - mnths ago and didn't find i was less able to cope with my depression. i do find that i feel depressed more often but i recognize the signs of the depression and use coping stragies to deal with what is happening."
1,"reduced pain in legs and forearms, and blocked the pain from the arthritis in my lower back.  the pain in my legs from the rls is considerably lessoned.  i also was in chronic pain from my arthritis, but can now move around without any pain, (unless i lift or do any type of work that is strenuous), but i used to be in so much pain that i would cry, so it was definitely worth it for me to take neurontin. none. three  mg. tabs in the a.m. and three  mg. tabs at bedtime."

0,"treatment benefits were to address pain and discomfort.  it was perscribed to me after i was in the hospital instead of vicaden (spelling?), as vicaden does not suite me well.  the medication began working after about  minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over  hours. treatment side effects for me were nausea and feeling unclear or 'loopy'. i found that if i took more than one pill within six hours, i became very nauseated.  in addition, i would not have been able to function properly or drive a car comfortably because of the side effects with my clarity. the treatment was for pain and was taken by myself for a situation that could not have been allieviated by medical attention.  i had an ovarian cyst rupture.  my doctor and the er told me there was really nothing for them to do other than wait for it to be reabsorbed.  so, pain medication was my last resort.  i took a few of these pills over two days to help alleviate my extreme pain."
1,able to sleep through the night sometimes difficult to wake up prescribed by a psychiatrist after the patient failed to get good results with over the counter sleep remedies.

1,"lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings i've been lucky with side effects. it has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. i had some very pleasant side effects when i first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. the only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word i was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which i am now treating separately and is much better.) neither of those effects are on the pi sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but i've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. regardless, the effects have been minimal and well worth it considering how much i've been helped. i started treatment when i was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation. i was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once i hit the theraputic dose of  mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. i still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, i'm able to push them away more easily.

i have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia, but i doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way."
1,"i have severe pain in my lower abdomin that was so strong i couldn't sleep nor move around very well. luckily i sit mostly at work so i was able to deal with a little while, but eventually i went to the er and they prescribed me this. which i have never heard or taken before. i have read that a lot of people who take this are very tired and sleepy. i believe that everyone's body reacts differently to drugs. as far as my side effects goes i feel great. almost a natural ""high"" if you will. i am very talkative and focused. i will say that i do not have much of an appetite. my stomach feels fine and the lower pain has gone away for the most part. i do realize i am taking more pills now because the effectivness has worn off a bit, doing my research on this i have heard that being the case many times. overall i am going to a obgyn specialist next week and they are going to  determine what is the exact problem. as urgent care and the hospitalcould not figure it out, which scares me truthfully. hopefully i will not have to take anything and the pain will go away. i recommend this to anyone who has moderate to severe pain as it has helped me dramatically, good luck to all. pain is not something i wish on anyone."
1,"paxil quickly improved my depression and also helped with mild anxiety issues i was experiencing.  i was very pleased with the speed with which my depression improved.  within four weeks i was feeling better than i had felt in a very long time.  i have been on it for two months and am still improving. during the second week i experienced stomach problems.  i had diarrhea that lasted for about a week.  i also had moderate headaches which lasted a little longer than the stomach issues. i went to the doctor due to problems associated with my depression.  i had been taking wellbutrin but it seemed to be losing its effect.  the doctor recommended adding another antidepressant to boost the wellbutrin.  i attempted three other anti-depressants but had severe side effects. zoloft, lexapro, and celexa all caused me to have severe diarrhea.  during the four weeks that i stayed with zoloft i experienced little improvement and lost  pounds as a result of the diarrhea and lack of appetite."
0,"while taking zyprexa, i never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany bipolar type ii; however, i attribute this mostly to the fact that zyprexa is very sedating. it should be noted that although zyprexa is classified as an a-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder. increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  i am not exaggerating when i say my appetite was almost insatiable. excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  it also made me feel almost ""numb"" emotionally.  sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over  pounds. my psychiatrist prescribed zyprexa to help with the mood swings of bipolar disorder.  i am classified as bipolar type ii because i do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany bipolar type i.  i do, however, experience hypomania (hypo meaning low) so my moods still swing from highs to the extreme lows of depression."
0,"possible slight improvements in texture. erectile problems,severe anxiety, panic attacks, negative thoughts, depression, brain fog. effected not only myself, but my family. this was not me. only took for three months. took much longer for side effects to subside. in my opinion a dangerous drug. may not have the same effect on everyone, but these side effects seem to be common enough to be documented and taken seriously. at this point seem to be being ignored. took once daily until side effects became unbearable."

1,"frova eliminated migraine headaches and the effect would last  hours. the effect was slow.  approximately one or two hours before any significant pain relief was noticed.  also, some nausea from the drug. as soon as a migraine was detected a frova would be administered.  if the migraine was intercepted immediately the frova was succesful with relieving pain and the chance of a rebound headache was slim.  if a frova was not administered immediately a maxalt was taken then two hours afterwards a frova.  this would eliminate pain for twenty four to thirty hours. on occasion a rebound headache would occur."

0,"stopped bleeding and relieved some abdominal cramps. after only  treatments i have developed common side effects, as in dizzines which keeps me from being too active. i am always tired even though i am finally sleeping most of the night, i have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about, and i have the need to constantly unrinate. i have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and i have just started. i believe that i am also suffering from depression, but because i am a single parent i try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily. have done  infusions, starting with  weeks after first and then  weeks. now i am awaiting my th which will be  weeks. the staff have been great, from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at bio-advance, but the one draw back is that i have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. so why did i find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?"
1,"trazodone allows me to fall asleep within ten minutes and sleep through the night, awaking in the morning without grogginess. i have noticed no side effects. i have never needed to increase my dosage over the course of five years, and when i skip a dose, my insomnia is exactly what it was before taking trazodone, no worse.  mg taken with water directly before bed puts me to sleep within ten minutes or so. i wake up - hours later (unless forced to get up earlier by my alarm clock) without feeling drugged or groggy. the insomnia being treated was the kind where i was able to fall asleep after about a half hour in bed, but then i would wake up again after a couple of hours and be unable to fall back asleep. this mild, nonaddictive drug has successfully addressed the insomnia that has affected me since childhood."
1,"i had tried every over the counter product for acid reflux and none of them worked. i also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as prevacid has. i have found that if i take it too early prior to going to bed, it's less effective. also, there have been a few times (very few) where it hasn't worked and i have gotten acid reflux (ash taste in mouth, vomiting, pain in throat and chest)  also, for whatever reason, there also have been times i have had to take  pills versus the usual  pill. one pill once a day. the ingredients are supposed to limit or decrease acid reflux."

1,"taking tramadol has resulted in the effective management of chronic pain due to severe tmj. the side effects of taking tramadol for  years is addiction.  if i miss a dose, i experience typical withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache, restless leg syndrome, stomach cramps). tramadol was prescribed after suffering from tmj for over  years. i suffered from chronic pain due to severe tmj complications.  in addition, the tmj was causing migraine headaches and insomnia.  after all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  because surgery for tmj conditions is not a guarantee for success, i was reluctant to agree to the procedure.  finally, as a last resort, i met with a doctor who specialized in chronic pain management and i was prescribed tramadol,  mg/twice daily.  this drug has worked extremely well for the past  years in controlling the pain."
1,the drug caused the depression to recede to the point that i was able to function normally. the libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (ssri) were alleviated completely. i was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other ssri occasionally i would have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep if i took the drug too late in the day. i began to take it upon wakening daily to counter those effects. i took one tablet per day  mg of the wellbutrin xl.

0,"mild lightening of age and sun spots. slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. increased sun sensitivity. started using the cream every other night and increased it to every night. it somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. i also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. i used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. the spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 
i would say i saw a % improvement in the sun spots on my face.  i have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 
i did not have much irritation when i started using this product but i had been using retin a before i started the tri luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. i did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when i used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.

1,"the treatment benefits were that the cephalexin relieved the sinus infection around the th day and by the seventh day my sinuses felt better. the cephalexin seemed relatively mild as i did not experience any intestinal discomfort, bloating or cramping that i have experienced with other antibiotics. i developed vaginitis and a yeast infection. this usually starts to occur around four or five days after i finish a round of antibiotics. this reaction to antibiotics first started to occur around ten years ago after i was treated with tetracycline for six months for a severe case of lyme's disease. i had a sinus infection and was instructed to take mg. of cephalexin every  hours for seven days. it took four days before the cephalexin took effect. i have a hard time getting an antibiotic that i don't have a negative reacton to. i am allergic to penecilan and can't take z-pack because it severely upsets my intestinal tract."
1,"this spray clears the nasal passages to promote free breathing. i've tried over the counter remedies but they are harsh and you end up practically addicted to them. this works much the same way but is non-addictive and need only be used when symptoms hit. i have used this same product when i've had a head cold and achieved the same results. i'm pretty sure that's not what it's intended for but whenever i've got sinus pressure, i take this product. i've experienced no side effects. simply shake the bottle, and use  sprays in each nostril daily."
1,"my blood pressure stayed in the normal range. the headaches i was having from hypertension subsided. i had no side effects i developed high blood pressure triggered, i feel, by stress from a divorce and possibly from hormone imbalance from stress due to the divorce and its ramifications. i would have headaches everyday and was checking my blood pressure while i was having a headache and at times when i did not have a headache. it was most definitely elevating during a headache. i tried one other medication first with no success. my dr. switched me to atenolol with good results. it also corrected the occasional premature cardiac beats i was having. the dosage is low so i continue to take it for the normal sinus rhythm as my blood pressure problem is now resolved."

1,"xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than i could have ever hoped for.  i spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  the worst part was, i always just thought i was lazy.  even after i was diagnosed, and was on provigil (i was taking provigil only for years before xyrem)i still questioned if i really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps i was just lazier than everyone else.  now that i take xyrem, i know that i really do have a sleep disorder because xyrem has changed my life so much.  i could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  without xyrem, i spend most too much time in rem sleep.  i would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after i would fall asleep.  almost every morning i would wake up and still be in a dream.  xyrem forces me into nrem sleep and it has made all the difference for me. im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  other side effects that may or may not be related that i experience (although i also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that i am not so exhausted and i can't imagine going back to life before xyrem.  dose right before bed and another - hours later."
1,"lamictal is by far the best medicine that i have been perscribed. it almost has completly controlled my depression which was very severe, and has almost completly controled my mania. i still get slightly hypomanic, but this has not been a problem for me. i originally took lamictal mg once a day for two months in march  and had to stop because of moderate memory loss(mild long term loss and  moderate/severe short term loss), loss of ballence, and fatigue.i was sometimes in a mental fog. i would repeat the same things several times an hour and not remeber that i had said it. when i first started taking lamictal i was leaving for college in a few months and my doctor(whom i no longer see)rushed me to raise my perscription very quickly.during that time it had completly controled my depression and mania. i am currently taking it, and started taking it again in september . i now take mg once a day. i have not had any side effects since i started taking it again in september.i partially believe that the reason it is so effective now is that i am  lbs heavier than i was when i first took lamictal and because i now take a lower dose."
1,the skin rash was better i can not be sure it was from the medication but i had mild stomach upset i originally had lamisil cream to treat a  pretty bad case of ringworm.  after about  days the rash was spreading and so i went back and received oral lamisil. i took that for  days and the rash was lighter but still there. the doctor then prescribed ketoconazole and after  days the rash was significantly lighter. by the end of the prescription the rash was almost completely gone.

1,"cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. the treatment benefits are long term. reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. sorry not  words. i suspect it caused increased hair loss (thining) which i became aware of after about two - two and a half years of using the medication. i had hair loss before ever starting medications but it seems like this medicine began increasing the problem. cosopt burned initially on application and turned the eyes red which cleared up fairly quickly. i am not aware of any other side effect. i switched medications and further explanation is below. if i knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes. i had elevated occular pressure that needed to be reduced and my doctor put me on xalatan which caused my eyelashes to begin to thicken and become dark in a couple of months so i had him put me on something else so we went to cosopt. after a time i felt like this was causing increased hair loss so i looked up drug side effects and cosopt was listed as causing hair loss so i had him change it again then i started alphagan p and azopt. my eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol . percent. the redness quickly went away. now with azopt in each eye once in the morning and once at bedtime and timilol . in both in the mornings only my occular pressures have been reduced one to two points lower in each eye than what the cosopt did when taken in the morning and at bedtime. these changes have not stopped the hair loss from occuring even though timilol . percent has half the timilol in it as the cosopt and is used only once a day in each eye vs cosopts twice a day in each eye. azopt is reported to cause hair loss and is very similar to the second ingredient in cosopt."
1,worked extremely well at preventing out breaks. an out break would come on and id start taking it and it would be gone withing  hours if i took it properly. massive amount of hair loss. i basically went from a full head of hair to half bald in a span of  years.also arthritis type pain between joints if you take too much for too long. sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. this stuff has some serious side effects. men feel the side effects much worse then woman do. make sure your doctor prescribes you  mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. its like the same price as the  mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.

1,"i added this medication  months after i began monthly infusions of orencia. orencia alone gave mild improvement in symptoms of severe rheumatoid arthritis. (i had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) within - weeks of beginning leflunomide (and still continuing orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. as i write this i have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage i've sustained. recently, i tried reducing my dose of leflunomide to  mg/day. after - weeks or so, i began to have more symptoms. when i resumed the mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about - weeks. i have some gi distress, but am not sure if it's directly due to leflunomide or to a long history of taking ra medications which also negative have gi effects.

i had a very serious eye infection last year which resulted in corneal scarring and loss of much vision in one eye. it's very possible that my immune-suppressed condition (leflunomide and orencia)resulted in a more serious infection and slower healing time than if i were not on immunosuppressants. one pill a day with dinner!"

prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  she told me her doctor had put her on elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  i went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for elavil. two weeks later i started going whole days
without head pain.  i went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  i looked
forward to doing things.  i woke up without pain.  what a miracle!  i have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  when
i do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  needless to say my entire life changed. i am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  i take the generic and notice no difference from
elavil.  thank you elavil. none that i noticed. i take one  mg tablet of generic elavil at bedtime."

1,"when bmi rating is over  its time to get that taken care of before it goes beyond that. i have taken adipex in my 's and lost  pounds in  weeks. i keep it off until i turned .  you have to exercise or this will not work. i am not a fan of exercising but when you get the burst of energy get up and move. if you are stuck behind a desk.. turn from side to side... do stretches.. then at lunch or break move!!! there are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. exercise is the magical word.
so get up and move it. walk.. dance.. or you will be stuck at the same weight. it takes work.. and a lot of it. it amazes me how there are those expecting a miracle in a pill. not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal jittery.. sometimes euphoric.. tired but cant sleep.. in a zone. last results  months on adipex-p lost  pounds. gained it back due to injury at work. currently on day  and working out with the nintedo wii and walking. if i am sitting i am not doing so still .. i do leg lifts .. twist my hips practice good breathing patterns for everyday health. its really beneficial to breath correctly. i am on a very low calorie intake diet. i eat  to  a day and it is not skipping a meal to eat ice cream.. no fat diet veggies.. fresh fruit and chicken . palm sized servings for everything.. extra no butter, fat, oils,
processed meats, dairy is low fat or fat free yogurt. daily vitamin and lots and lots of water to replenish so you don't get fatigued.  im on my way..  pounds down and  to go. good luck this can work for most people with no excuses other then a underlying disease .. if so its obvious you shouldn't be taking adipex. good luck all .. dont get weak. and if you mess up make sure its worth it.. that extra serving dont let it be more then a half cup and only if you can burn it off. good luck all and remember don't give up.. don't cheat yourself with extra licks from the brownie bowl.. tasting samples of dinner before serving. those are huge calories not counted for that can ruin your diet. take care and get moving!!"
1,"for the most part the pain was taken away just enough that i could function.  i like that it's not a narcotic, yet gives some of the benefits of one. because it only took away part of the pain i thought it would be ok to take  more tablets.  that was a really bad idea.  i started to feel pressure in my head, i felt like i was going to faint, my lips started to tingle.  the worst effect though was that about  min after my heart started going extremely fast then started skipping over and over.  it was very scary.  i then read that a person can die from and overdose.  i feel like i dodged death.  very important! take this as prescribed. this med was the drug of choice for me since i am in recovery for alcohol."

all that went away or got better with some time. i also found out why it was happening- i was malnourished. once i started drinking -oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish. 

i still have dilantin side effects which are easy to distinguish as i've been on that since , but the topamax ones are gone barring once and awhile i have a bit of 'loss of words' while speaking. i love this drug. i take one mg tab in the morning and one mg tab in the evening. i take the brand name topamax as the generic one caused my blood levels to dive a bit and i had a breakthrough seizure. too bad as the generic is much cheaper."
1,"helped the depression initially, was far more positive during the years i took it, but the efficacy of the drug began to deteriate, and the onset of new side effects led me to try to live without the treatment initially, not many, some loss of concentration when driving longer than half hour periods, eyes felt very heavy, and it felt like part of my brain had shut down, struggled not to fall to sleep. after some time, about six years, i started to get night sweats, very uncomfortable, and mood swings. i thought it might be hormaonal, but after taking away the drug , the symptoms alleviated. i now feel that i have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time, and part of the reason i was depressd was i found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time, i had two very young children , and was not diagnosed with a condition . if i had understood my condition better, i may have managed the fibromyalgia better. i was pushing my body too hard, as i felt frustrated t not managing everything better, and the cycle of depression continued. i have come off the venlafaxine, and the symptoms of pain, particularly in the morning have returned, but i can manage them better, knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition, and that it is 'normal' for me. i pace myself better, and no longer have the demands of very young children , so can do that easier. i like being 'drug' free, although i do supplement with fish oils and  htp"

1,"my cholesterol levels were terrible.  i was around  years old with, as the doctor said, ""the cholesterol of a  year old man.""  it may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. over the past  years my hdl levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as i wish it was)! niaspan is a high dose of niacin (vitamin b) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of mg.  my cholesterol levels were screwy, and i had a more holistic doctor at the time.  she wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  i was instructed to take the dose right before i went to bed.  i took the first dose about an hour before bed, and i turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  i was really hot and really uncomfortable.  i went to lay down and try to sleep, but i couldn't get comfortable.  it was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  after about - minutes the flush subsided, and i was able to fall asleep.  so it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  i've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while i'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up. i started with mg and stayed at that level for about  years.  then, after i moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to mg/night.  my liver stats were being monitored because of another medication i was taking (mercaptopurine), so i'm relatively sure i haven't had any adverse liver effects with this drug."

i like to consider it in the same way i did avonex for all those years; it sucks, but it keeps me on my toes and therefore worth it. very simple once you establish a simple routine.  ""shared solutions"", the company behind copaxone provides you with everything you need for each injection, including; in home injection training, which i was able to get down with just one session, but they will come as often as you need.

you load an injection tool with a syringe.  remove the cap from the syringe (simple).  wipe the inection site with a kind of cheap, provided alcohol wipe.  let the alcohol dry (-) seconds.  place the tip of the tool on the injection site, press a button and the tool injects the shot in about - seconds.  it varies.  yeah, i called them cheap alcohol wipes, but they are good enough and i'm picky.  i buy my own because they are inexpensive.

1,"this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for  years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all. initial dosage was  mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about  years, at which point it was raised to  mgs. each day.  ultimately, the dosage was raised again approximately - years after the first increase to my current dosage of  mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido. basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor, as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication."

0,"i initially had severe cramping and nausea, but i continued under doctor's orders, i only lost about  pounds, tops.  i now have a larger host of problems i believe were started with this medication.  i have not used in  years. severe cramping, headaches, incredible nausea, muscle cramps, vomiting blood (not once but on  occasions due to doctor's orders).  i now am facing something wrong with my digestive tract and no doctor has been able to figure out what is wrong.  since this is the area where the medication was injected, and only there, i believe that the byetta is the perfect suspect.  now, if i could only find a doctor that will listen to me.  the count is  and still increasing.  recently, i lost  pounds in  days!!!!  this is not normal! i was to inject the said amount into the abdominal (below the waist, above the pelvic bone) before breakfast and lunch.  the amount was changed when the medical professional i was having treat me decided to increase the dosage, and with terrible results (i was vomiting blood and could not eat or even drink water - i couldn't even stand the smell of food).  i wish i had never heard of byetta!!!!!!"
1,"i have been plagued with peristent mutiple warts on my elbow for over  years. at christmas - i decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the summer. i used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  i then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  i could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
i used a thin smear of acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  if i left the cream off - they would start again.  i persisted with the cream daily for  weeks and for the first time in  years or more my arm is 'wart free' and i have healthy unbroken wart free skin. none - in fact it gave great relief to sore irritated skin as new 'wart' blister tried to form. 

i suggest a clinical trial to be used in conjunction with cryotherapy to prevent spread and regrowth - once warts are treated. it is certainly more successful in eliminating 'emerging warts' and preventing regrowth than the recommended salicylic acid - which does more harm then good. this may be a marketing oportunity for you as re-growth is often more of a problem than treating the original wart."
0,"i only started this medication to still treat my anxiety and mild depression, but eliminate the desire not to want sex. irritable, sleeplessness, rages of angry, fatigue, high blood pressure my obgyn switched me from prozac to wellbutrin in efforts to help with the sexual side affects.   well, it did absolulte nothing to help in that area and instead made me more depressed, irritable, had severe rages, crying all the time, no desire to get out of bed, hot flashes and my blood pressure spiked tremendously.   i went back to my pcp and i'm back to zoloft which i had taken in the past and although i'm still having w/d's from the wellbutrin, i'm felling % better in it's only been  days.   i tossed all the remaining pills out.    this drug clearly didn't work for my body.   what a horrible experience to go through.    i will in the future only get these types of meds from my pcp and not my obgyn."
0,"advair helped with my asthma initially, which was agrivated by an upper resperitory virus. heart palpitations and coughing.  these side affects have been decreasing since i discontinued the drug.  advair seems to be fine for a short time, only to aggravate things later on. i was treated for asthma which kicked up during the winter cold season, and my doctor put me on advair and prednisone (short dose).  i continued on the advair for four months and as time went on the side affects became more and more pronounced.  my doctor currently has me off of all steroids and the advair and is watching me for any complications.  blood tests for thyroid and glucose came back within normal levels."

0,"i didn't feel that there were any benefits. i initially started taking wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. i really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. i immediately switched back to effexor. after a couple of days of taking the drug, i started experiencing severe flash anger. the smallest nuisance would set me off. i remember actually throwing something across my dining room. it was awful. at that point i decided to no longer take the drug. i am not certain what i should describe here. the treatment details were that i was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and i never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one. i am not certain if other people have had similar experiences or not, but it wasn't pleasant."

1,of all of the birthcontrol pills i've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  it helped control my acne and kept me thin.  after several years i did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after i stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  i was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and i had a completely different reaction.  i instantly gained about  pounds (mostly water weight i think because i looked puffy).  i found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  i learned the hard way. i never got pregnant. i took the same little pill for  days and then the placebo pills for another  days of the month.

0,"taking  mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that i did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  i immediately felt better after i started the regimen in the spring of .  my cough went away and i had a lot more energy.
i took this regimen for about  years, everyday.  i also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was i doing before it???)  it was as if my brain cleared up or something.  i breathed easier and i was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  i worked over  hours/week before and during this treatment. the side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  i started feeling weak and i bruised easily.  i acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  i was tired and started feeling cranky.  i stopped taking warfarin for  months but then went back to it after i had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  during the  months that i wasn't taking warfarin, i felt better, had more energy.  but then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and i was starting to get headaches.  so i went back on it.  this time my doctor said i might have to increase dosage to  mg. since i hadn't been taking the warfarin.  however, when i had my thrombin checked, i was okay at  mg.; i took this for another  months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  the same scenario was repeated (started feeling like i had ""thick"" blood and now i had increasingly bad headaches).  i went back on  mg. of warfarin in august of this year but only took them for  months. then i started a vitamin/mineral/coq regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  i credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to vitamin e and the fact that i also changed my diet.  i try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and i have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but i feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  i do eat salmon and tuna.  the final straw for me with warfarin was that i started feeling really mad about things.  the littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   when my teenaged daughter started crying after i ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and i heard my words echoing in my house, i knew that was it.  i quit warfarin and started taking  mg. of aspirin daily (i had a headache every morning after i went off warfarin).  i started the vit./min. regimen in november, gradually adding supplements as i learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until - weeks ago that i realized i wasn't having any headaches and i was able to stop taking  mg. of aspirin. also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), i have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, i am also more prone to control my anger because i really didn't like how i had been), i do not feel depressed.  i have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  why didn't the doctors tell me? treatment consisted of simply taking  mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  i was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so i'm sure when i was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  and then when i would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  i really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and i think that's smart advice.  i must say add that i always loved the feeling of donating blood before i took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as i initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  i would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because i don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  couldn't they take less blood?  who determined how much blood you can give anyway?"

as far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. i'm sure it has saved lives. with one inhalation i am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if i am having a bad attack, and am really strugling. so it is very effective but, when i use albuterol i experience mild chest pains afterward. not immediately, but typically later that day or the next. they don't last long, just a sharp pain or two, but it does occur fairly often. in my case, since i don't use albuterol regularly, it's well worth it. inhalation, pump spray"

as time went on i began to heal and feel much better and now it tends to work much better. sometimes trouble breathing and trouble urinating.  also, felt drowsy during the day.  the breathing and the urinating problems stopped after about a week on this medication.  as for the drowsy feeling, i still experience that and try not to drive while on this medication.  i experience no other side effect even though i am still taking the medication. due to a slip and fall accident, i needed to get back surgery for my condition.
the type of surgery i had was called anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion for cervical disc displacement.  the doctor prescribed oxycodone along with naproxen.  i rarely took the naproxen but took the oxycodone four times a day for two months.  at this time, i still take the medication only when i feel i need it - approximately once or twice a day."

1,"no diarrhea and better drug efficacy. none at all.  the person who previously reviewed had an allergic reaction.  that does not mean the drug doesn't work, that means she simply can't tolerate the medication. my father is in a wheelchair.  for those of you with handicapped family and friends, you know how difficult urinary tract infections can be.  ciprofloxin was a major break through for uti's.  unfortunately, paralyzed men and women have trouble holding their bowel movements due to the ""dumping"" effect of cipro releasing directly into the gut.  although not widely promoted just know that proquin xr has truly changed my father's life.  instead of being hospitalized once a year due to a uti, he can now take proquin xr and continue on with his normal daily life/work etc.  proquin xr basically allows the body to metabolize more of the medication and this in turn makes the medication more efficacious.  in layman's terms, it works faster and more effectively.  if you have digestive issues due to cipro or any antibiotic, you seriously need to try this medication.  it has not only helped my father but has made my family's life much easier."

1,"immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. also, i wouldn't always take lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming lexapro, i experienced results in - days. in the beginning, i felt a little dazed and disoriented for the first - weeks of taking lexapro. once my body adjusted to the drug, i felt like it took the edge off irritability and made me feel like my old self. sustaining side effects were sexual; a decrease in ability to orgasim.  mg of lexapro was prescribed to be taken x daily. i was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of - weeks."
1,"i've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest i ever came to a ""cure"". 
granted, it was after i stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but i never experienced this with other anti-depressants. while taking it, effexor made me so sleepy all the time that i slept a good deal more than normal (- hours daily). this is why i stopped taking it. but when i did, i felt better than i had in years. i remained depression-free for about  years. i then dealt with depression again for about - months (i didn't want to lose another - weeks taking the effexor ""cure"" so i delayed, hoping i would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). when i finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, i returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so i tried cymbalta, hoping to get effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. it worked well as long as i used it, but when i stopped, there was no ""cure"" like i'd had with effexor. now i take - mg of same. it's not as good as the post-effexor experience, but i feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and i focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the same comes in. it makes the difference. as indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time. i began effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. my depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and i had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. when i had to run errands, like grocery shopping, i felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. my treatment with effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where i was. at best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. i had moments of feeling fully functional. that was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. that's when i stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". if i ever experience such a deep depression again, i will choose to try the effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the cymbalta. with the cymbalta, i would already know that the benefits would only last as long as i chose to be on it, whereas, the effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission."

0,"i was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic i was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  the prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost. sleeplessness!  taking the prednisone was like drinking ten cups of coffee every night or like being on speed.  i had unnatural amounts of energy -- nervous energy -- and wore myself out during the time i was taking the prednisone.  it always helped to clear up the infection, but then i had to recover from the prednisone.  this is a scary drug. in addition to whatever antibiotic i was currently on, i was to take  mg. of prednisone -- the first few times, it was  mg with each meal, but that was really too much, so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days, sometimes as few as , sometimes as many as .  then, i had to taper off the amount i took for several days, in  mg increments for a few days each new dose.  finally, i would be off it.  this time."

1,"treatment benefits from taking methotrexate included significantly reduced inflammation in the joints which led to reduced pain.  overall fatigue was also minimized. the day after the injection i was extremely worn out.  almost like having the flu.  i took the shot on friday nights, went to bed around pm, and then wasn't able to get up before noon the next day, simply due to severe fatigue.  after saturday, i typically felt pretty good, though. once weekly injections with methotrexate.  also took prescription-strength folic acid to minimize any side effects."

0,"while i definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, i believe that zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. my depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone. from my personal experience, this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. i had become a zombie, not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. my emotions had been totally flattened. my libido was gone. i had absolutely no desire for any kind of sexual activity.  mg per day, in the mornings. total duration of the treatment:  years.

0,"symptoms were numbed, i was able to better ""deal"" with life and get through my days without crying or having a nervous epsiode i felt numb and low energy. it was like living in a cloud. i also gained a lot of weight which in turn made me feel bad and sad for myself all over again. i just took one a day, in the morning. when i would voice my concern about the perks of the drug with my doctor, he was just adjust the dosage or try me on something else. i wished he would have advised me to do some psychological exercises to accompany the treatment."
0,"it was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day, you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for  weeks. i noticed that i felt really down around month two of taking in, my mood swings were severe, i felt tired all the time. i could also feel the ring during sex and it frequently came out during sex. although it is convenient, it almost defeats the purpose of birth control if you have to worry all the time that the ring is going to come out. also, mood swings and feelings of tiredness were almost unbearable. would not recommend it."
1,the rx cleared up my conjunctivitus. it was fast & easy to use. i was surpised @ how quickly it worked. it does sting when you use but on the other hand as soon as the pink eye goes away it doesnt sting anymore. it stings a little & you can't wear contacts until its over. you get a  ml eye drop bottle & use - drops - x a day until it goes away. i still have half a bottle left.
1,"went from severely depressed before starting the medication to almost entirely free of depression a week after starting the medication; helped with insomnia. drowsiness in the beginning, but i quickly got used to it. i entered a hospuital six years ago for suicidality; i wasn't sleeping, i wasn't eating (i had anorexia nervosa), and i was extremely depressed. i started taking mg of zyprexa the first night i was there. i was really drowsy all the next day, but it waned over a few days (now it doesn't affect my energy level at all.) in about a week, my depression just lifted. this medicine has worked miracles for me- i've been depression-free since starting it- and i wouldn't go off it for any reason."

1,"my skin felt much softer and my breakouts were far less frequent. my pores also looked smaller. the routine was also easy to maintain, as it only required nightly application. my breakout were more frequent and severe when i first began this treatment. also the cream itself was a little to heavy, it may work better for those with dry skin. i did not notice increased sun sensitivity or significant dryness. i would have preferred this treatment if it was a gel or a light lotion, and not a heavy cream. i would apply the avita  minutes after washing my face every night, wash it off in the morning, and apply sunscreen on my face."

1,"this has enabled me to take half the amount of hydrocodone that i used to take.  the gabapentin potentiates the hydrocodone wonderfully.  it allows me to sleep better also.  it doesn't knock me out, just allows me to go to sleep when i want, dream, and wake up not groggy. i've also had fewer migraines since i've been on the gabapentin. very very mild and occasional dizziness, usually when used in combination with imitrex. i take  mg three times a day, with hydrocodone, and three hundred mg at night before bed."

1,"the drug prevents the pustules that can result from rosacea.  when i do not take the drug for a week, the pustules tend to reappear. when i first started the drug, i felt nauseated for a few days.  it gradually subsided.  it helped to take the drug with food, although i initially was told to take it  hours after eating.  now i can tolerate it better, but still must take it at about the same time every day or it bothers my stomach and i get nauseated. my rosacea had progressed to the second stage (pustules) before i was diagnosed.  i woke up one morning with pustules on my face, and one was infected.  i went immediately to a dermatologist, who diagnosed me with rosacea and prescribed  mg of doxycycline daily.  i tried that, but my stomach would not tolerate it.  he lowered the dose to  mg, and i did better, although it took a few days to adjust."

0,"the medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression. unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. the tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. the tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication. i was prescribed wellbutrin, was on it for approximately  months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days."
1,"carac is used once a day as a topical cream in order to remove pre cancerous cells.  it did a great job of removing all bad cells.  i used it before going to bed.  i only used it  weeks because i had the reaction quicker than most. the side effects are that your face becomes very red - like a bad sunburn. you put the cream (carac) on the bad cells whereever they may be, once a day for three weeks.  over time you skin will have a reaction, become like a bad sunburn and then begin to peel.  carac will only attack the fast growing bad cells.  i had a great reaction to carac so it worked extremely well for me."
0,the drug cleared my sinuses but took some time to become effective after use. the effect only lasted about half a day. i would take this off and on for about  months. i felt like i was hopped up the whole time. my skin would feel crawly and i would be generally jittery and not able to focus. i lost concentration and felt high the whole time. it also made me feel really dehydrated. the medication was for my use during a sinus infection at first to help relieve congestion. when the sinus infection subsided i still had congestion fairly often so was prescribed to take is as needed. i would usually take one in the morning when it was worst. i stopped after a few months due to side effects and made diet changes to relieve it.

lows...my lows have been better. i did not find any side effects. the treatment was for slowing down the progression of memory loss. and it has!"
0,"the drug does get the patient to sleep very soon after taking the drug. the side effects are not worth it.  while it gets you to sleep, it makes you incredibly groggy the next day.  i had problems concentrating.  also, i started sleepwalking with no memory of my actions.  this can be very dangerous.  also, after taking it for a few days, it would become difficult to stop taking it.  i would rather not get as much sleep rather than take this medication.  i only take it a few times a year now mostly to reset my clock if i've traveled, but would never take it on a regular basis. the treatment does not require very much other than taking the prescribed drug as needed.  however, if you take it a few nights in a row, it it difficult to stop.  but you should stop because it makes you very groggy and gives you headaches during the day.  it is good for a sleepness night when back from traveling so that you can get back on a regular sleep schedule.  it should not be taken on a regular basis."

1,"my husband started taking aciphex when it first came out because he could not take any of the others. he started getting better after few months and stopped taking it afew times because insurance would not approve it. he immediately became ill and ended up in the hospital. now after  yrs my husband has no symptoms other than occasional acid reflux when eating anything with tomato sauce. there were no side effects other than if he discontinued the medication he would become ill and end up in the hospital. acipkex supposedly at the beginning was just a healing drug to be taken for a limited time. the only side effect would be not taking the medicine as prescribed. my husband tried all of the other acid reducers on the market, over the counter and prescriptions. aciphex is the only medicine he can take and live a happy ,normal healthy lifestyle without becoming sick.my husband still takes the aciphex, but if he had to can actually go for months without it."

1,"i used the product to try to reduce previous sun damage as well as discoloration and wrinkles created by aging (i'm currently ).  i feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  this may be due to the discontinuation of the .% formulation which would of course be more potent that the .% that i could get.  i will try retin a next time around to go for the .% and see if results improve further. treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  i had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  this never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  the two items that were noted is that i was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  i also did find, as stated, that i would burn much more easily in the sun. my skin care program prior to renova was wash with cetaphil, tone with a paula begoun antioxidant toner, % glycolic acid gel, moisturizer.  same in the evening.  after adding renova, same routine in morning but in evening i went to:  wash with cetaplil, tone with same product as before, wait  minutes, apply renova.  on alternate nights, i add a skin recovery antioxidant about  minutes after the renova."
1,"i have no more panic attacks, it helped to reduce anxiety, to improve the mood. i feel the old myself again and can function well at work.sometimes i still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. i highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs. none, the only disadvantage was it started working after  weeks of usage. the treatment is supposed to last -. years"
1,"before taking lexapro, i had constant anxiety.  i wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but i was having them one in awhile.  my anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  i was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  once i started taking lexapro, that all changed.  it did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms i experience now.  i am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  i know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success. i have never experienced any side effects.  i take it every morning and it's like taking an asprin...you don't notice any type of change.  if i miss my dose a few days in a row, i notice my behavior changes and i get moody and worry-some, but it takes a few days to experience that. i have taken  mg a day, every day, for the last  years.  it took a few weeks for the medicine to take effect (about ) and the chance was gradual, but one day i woke up and noticed that i felt normal.  it has been wonderful for me and i am very thankful i have access to it."

preserve sex drive i am not aware of any side effects from this drug, i did not experience any. doctor told me i could take as little as / tablet per day if i wanted. i take one per day and i am very happy with the results. if i accidentally skip one day, i know fairly soon that i have missed it because i get chills or start to have hot flashes."
1,"my heart rate was rapid (usually - bpm) and i frequently had feelings in my heart that left my short of breath for a few minutes.  my heart rate slowed down to normal (usually - bpm) and i very seldom have these episodes anymore.  i feel much better overall and i do not have that feeling of ""impending doom"".  also my blood pressure is good and i do not have to take an extra medication for this problem. the only noticeable side effect for me is the drop in blood pressure, which for me has been beneficial. i have been told this medication can make you somewhat sleepy or lethargic, but i have not experienced this. i take atenolol once a day in the morning and that's all the treatment that i need to keep the mitral valve in my heart function correctly."
1,"miracle drug for anyone who's deathly afraid of giving speeches or oral presentations. eliminates the whole butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, racing heart, sweaty palms and allows you to focus on what your doing and do it properly rather than worry about how nervous you are. none. the doc first suggested that i take paxil every day for  wks before a speech and then get off it. i had to push her to prescribe me inderal instead because i had researched all the drugs extensively and new what i was looking for. never rely entirely on the judgement of doctors, always verify their advice and do your own research.  it can save you time, money and alot of side effects.  

i take  small tablets and hour before a major speech or presentation (about once a year).  i am thinking about using it for situational anxiety as another user suggested, i had never thought about it as i try to stay as far from drugs as possible and i only use them in extreme situations, but i have missed many networking opportunities because of my anxiety and i think that this drug would have helped.  i have not experienced any side-effects.  i don't think the drug has significantly risky long-term effects.  i think the long-term negative effects of situational anxiety are far worse then the potential risks of inderal."

1,"this is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  my outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to  at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. with a shot of cortizone every couple of years, clobex takes care of the rest.  when i do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if i treat them right away, i only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. i should mention that i need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks. nothing bad. put a very small amount on my hands, smooth over all of my fingers.  use twice a day during an active outbreak.  use a couple of times a week thereafter, as prevention.  i also use lots of moisturizer and wear gloves for cleaning tasks, etc."
0,"none, especially surprising since the prescription name brand luvox had been used previously, with great results.  the luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry, while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing, and did not help with sleep. some vague nausea, which was not a problem with the name brand drug. at the time of weaning my second child, i was apparently experiencing some hot flashes/night sweats and worry/ panic and tried fluvoxamine, the generic version of luvox (which i had used previously by about four years).  i had successfully used luvox and was able to discontinue it without any side effects or symptoms of worry returning.  this time only the generic was available to me so i tried it - thinking that it would be the same drug and provide similar results.  it did not.  i experienced nausea, and did not get any sleep benefits, although i felt that the luvox had improved my sleep when taken at night; neither version of the drug caused any drowsiness.  i did not feel any improvement in symptoms with the generic version.  perhaps my hormones needed to balance on their own, and were too intense for the fluvoxamine to modify.  i hope there will be something better available if menopause eventually causes a return of symptoms.  
some generics are better than others, and individual reactions differ.  it is useful to have this rating information available to access online."

1,synthyroid replaces thyroid hormones that provide energy and increase your metabolism. i had a small goiter that was diminished when i began taking the medicine. if i miss a few days i have very little energy and feel as if i'm carrying heavy suitcases around. my skin has white spots on it due to lack of pigment. i have read that synthroid causes skin pigment loss and wrinkles. i f the dose is too high then i feel nervous and jittery. i take mcg every morning. it is suppose to be taken on an empty stomach but i simply take it before breakfast. my thyroid hormone levels have to be checked annually to make sure the dosage is effective.
1,"was able to successfully, and completely, discontinue illicit use of heroin/opiates.  i did remain abstinent for a period of time w/o it, but no longer than - months.  always at or before that point i would wind up relapsing again, with no good outcomes.  have stayed opiate-free for  year,  months now, and continue suboxone treatment. only negative(/side) effects noted are:
don't take doses too close together - feel dehydrated, headaches, fatigued.
do not neglect meeting w/prescribing physician for writing of next script. ive had to miss + appts before, and have gone b/t - days w/o medication.  i highly suggest to avoid that. i initially started at mg (/half mg tablet) x in am.  gradually rose to  mg tablet x in am, and then  mg tablets x in am.  i found that, as said above, if i took doses too close together (ex: noon on sunday, then am monday), would feel odd, off, and very drained.  so now i take  mg tab in am, and  mg tab in pm.  found to be very effective and feel very 'steady' and 'even' throughout the day, and night.  no issues with taking am/pm's too close together, or far apart.
also go to group & individual counseling, and see psychotherapist (as well as intermittent aa/na meetings) to stay active in recovery and stay healthy and well, all around.  also do the aforementioned to stay on top of depression and anxiety as well as reg life issues."

1,"the treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness', lack of focus, fatigue and irrational mood swings that i had experienced on every other non-zyban supported attempt to quit smoking. the treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken. at mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. in contrast, at mg/d - which i could handle for only a short period - i felt ""shaky"" with restless legs and some insomnia. these problems went away when i reverted to mg/d. i feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose, and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. perhaps zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations. i began taking mg/d two weeks/  days before my actual quit date. on the quit date, i also started a series of yoga classes and regular physical activity through the first few months of smoking cessation. i decided to continue taking zyban beyond the recommended period to a full  months at  dose daily. in my experience, i would recommend a lower daily dosage of mg/d for a longer extended period of time given my success in using zyban in this manner."

0,"essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits. the main side effects were fatigue and dizziness, which became worse with increasing dose. this medication was intended to reduce patient use of narcotics by providing adjunctive treatment of chronic pelvic pain, as indicated by several studies. i have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. most patients experience no benefit, or if there is any benefit, it occurs at small doses. titrating the dose up seems to worsen side effects without providing any added benefit. in addition, it is a costly drug."
1,"the treatment benefits were to counteract underactive thyroid conditions. specifically, it kept my metabolism from being too slow, which meant that it diminished face swelling, kept my skin and hair from becoming dry, and from me feeling unusually cold and tired. i did not experience any side effects from this medication. i am taking . of synthroid once a day, every day. i take it in the morning, before i eat any food."
1,"assisted with stopping smoking vivid dreams, dry mouth  tablets each day - for  weeks continue smoking and then stop after  weeks. i don't know how this works but i really did not like smoking when taking this. the treatment still requires a fairly high degree of willpower to manage the cravings. i keep a checklist of things to do - brush my teeth, drink water, go for a walk. i have now been smoke free for  months and at times it's still hard - i do still get cravings but they don't last very long and i can control them. another good tip i got was to put some butts in a jar with some water. a quick sniff of this and the thought of smoking goes away."

1,"the benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. it also had a midly energizing effect. very occassionally a racing feeling if i took the two doses too close together. i've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (zoloft, prozac, effexor) that loses it's effect after time. wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me."

1,"used for weight management and food intake control.  it is also supposed to give energy.  it definitely worked for cutting my appetite as long as i took it twice a day.  if i took it once a day at about  am i would feel hungry at about pm.  if i took it twice a day  am am i could make it to bedtime without being hungry. side effects were random for me most of the times.  i would definitely not feel the energy that it was supposed to give me.  sometimes when i would take it it would have the opposite affect on me and actually make me crash.  on some days it would make me feel foggy and other days i'd feel crisp and clear.  i also broke out with pimples on it.  you have to remind yourself to eat.  some days i'd also have trouble falling a sleep. i would take  mg pill in the morning at about am and then another mg pill at about am (sometimes trouble falling asleep if taken later).  i have done that for  months.  at the beginning i started off with only  pill a day.  i try to ""self administer"" my breaks in taking the medicine because i've heard it was addictive and i don't want to be addicted."

1,the benefits are less depression and better mood. it took about two weeks until i started to feel better but now i feel i may need something a bit stronger as i feel i am too used to taking this medication. i plan to ask for a higher dosage or different medication. really none. i don't really know what the details would be except that i started with mg and was increased to mg within two weeks.

0,"lessened depression it made me groggy during the day & made me sleep the sleep of the dead at night (not such a bad side effect).  i also had dry mouth & it sometimes caused mild nausea on an empty stomach. i took this med after trying others for depression.  it worked pretty well.  i decided to taper my dose down when i got pregnant & was off completely when my son was about one month old.  since then, i have kept my depression under control effectively through diet & exercise."

0,"the benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem i was experiencing.  at the time when i was experiencing complications from the implants, i truly believed that my doctor did not prescribed the drug in time.  the literature i read on this drug claims that it is more likely to work if used early in the treatment of capsular contracture. i tolerated the medication very well.  i didn't experience any illness or side effects from accolate.  i felt a strong mental negativity towards the drug when it was prescribed based on the literature i read and my doctor's statement about being treated early.  i think i tried the treatment knowing in my mind that it was not going to work. i was required to take accolate for three months to promote softening of my breast implants. the mg tablets were to be taken twice daily along with continued daily massage of my breasts.  my doctor said that the treatment had more chances of being effective if used early in detecting the capsular contracture (my treatment was started  months after the breast implant surgery).  if the treatment didn't work, he advised, i would need surgery."

0,"the tetracycline helped to reduce acne lesions. tetracycline was heavy on the stomach and if you ask me added to yellowing of my teeth but that is a subjective view. mostly it caused stomach gas and disturbance. i had constant vaginal yeast infections because (i believe) of the imbalance of good bacteria. the treatment was, at that time, one of the treatments for acne. being a systemic treatment, it did decrease the acne lesions but only on continued use. as soon as it was discontinued, the acne returned as usual. it was to use x per day indefinitely and so was not the best idea but at the time did prevent the gross acne lesions that would have occured without."
1,lexapro seemed to work well for me.  i suffered from panic attacks in the past and the lexapro definitely helped with these.  the lexapro also assisted with symptoms of depression. did not have any treatment side effects my doctor started me on a very low dose to treat some situational depression and panic attacks.  the mg did not work well enough and eventually i was given  and then .  the mg seemed to do the trick without any additional side effects.

1,"i have had stomach troubles my entire life. when i was pregnant they were unbearable.  i could never take the pill because of nausea. i noticed that when i was  the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  my gastroenterologist prescribed nexium, which i took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. then the other symptoms above emerged. when i started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and i rarely ever have stomach problems now. none at all that i am aware of. prior to taking the oral treatment i used the cream, to avoid the digestive tract altogether.  this was fine for about a year, but then the symptoms reappeared.  my physician felt that something was interfering with the absorption of the hormones and so prescribed the oral pill and the symptoms have nearly disappeared and i have had no associated stomach problems.   i am convinced that much of my stomach problems throughout my life were associated with a hormonal imbalance, but cannot prove this.  i do know that this is the best my stomach has ever been in my entire life, for whatever reason."
0,"always prescribed together with topical antibiotics such as klaron.  quite effective in curing acne, but takes months and situation gets worse in the first week to month. tazorac can peel the skin severely when used together with other medication.  still moderate peel when applied once every night. i'm an asian female in my s and have been having moderate acne problem for over  years.  amoung over-the-counter medication, only benzal peroxide works for me, but i still have break-outs from time to time.  my primary care doctor prescribed tazorac and klaron for me about  years ago and it was very effective in clearing up the acnes in a few months.  but even the prescription cannot fully cure the problem and doesn't prevent future break-outs."
1,"the runny nose would stop about  minutes after i used flonase, but would return again within hours after taking the medication. it definitely cleared my sinuses, but sometimes left my nose feeling dry. probably better as a sinus clearer than at alleviating all allergy symptoms. there were no treatment side effects. treatment only involved twice a day use, squirting the liquid up each nostril. not inconvenient at all."
1,"allegra minimized the allergy symptoms without the side effect of drowsiness that is typical of over-the-counter allergy medications such as benadryll.  after taking the drug, congestion is greatly reduced and the constant sneezing stops.  however, allegra is not very effective for itchy, dry eyes, which continues to be a problem during peak allergy season. no side effects have been observed during the  years of use.  drowsiness has not been an issue and no reactions to other medications have been experienced. one tablet is taken per day whenever allergy symptoms are moderate to severe.  no medication is taken on days when allergies are mild."

1,"dapsone treated the intensly itchy skin condition quickly and efficiently.  a gluten free diet alone did not relieve this condition. the side effects after one year have been a slight decrease in red blood count.  there has also been an onset of shakyness which i believe has been a side effect. -mg tablets are taken at bedtime.  the dosage is self medicating, which means that if the condition is under control i can lower the doseage to see if the contrlo can be maintained at a lower dose.  so far, after one year, i have been unable to do so."

1,"the drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  it did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and i felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which i had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants. at first i had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  i did not have any trouble falling asleep.  i had very high energy for the first  weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  i wish the energy had remained.  i did not lose any weight, which i was hoping for...but i did not gain any either, so that was positive. i started on  mg for  weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  it seemed like as soon as i was switched to the generic mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  there is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  i really enjoyed the energy.  i weaned myself off after  year because i didn't need it anymore.  i did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  overall it was a positive experience, although i was glad to not need it anymore."
1,"i switched from diane , a birth control pills recommended specifically for acne and was very worried that the nuva ring would cause an acne flair up, as switching from diane to yasmine had. fortunately my skin stayed just as clear and as a plus no more taking pills nightly slight vaginal irritation at the end of a cycle, nothing even moderately serious though. nuva ring is a brand name birth control method which releases hormones through the vaginal walls. you insert a flexible plastic ring once a month for three weeks and it acts as birth control."

0,"none severely decreased libido, brain fog/mental blankness, muscle weakness, impotence, penile shrinkage. given mg propecia for ~one week in /, noticed instant compromise of sexual capacity and an increase in anxiety & confusion. stopped because of this experience, however did not completely regain libido, sexual function or mental sharpness as promised. tried treatment again two years later thinking my experience was normal and would subside with continued use (as indicated in drug info), until the same exact thing happened. i researched the symptoms and learned i was not alone thanks to propeciahelp.com, i stopped once again and have strived to reverse the damages since to no avail."
0,"to tell the truth, i did not benefit very much from this medication, even though i was taking maximum doses, the pain remained almost the same with or without medication. maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment, unfortunately not in my case. i did not experience many side effects, even though i was taking many pain medications at a time, i could say very little drowsiness, but compared with other people taking the same medication, i would say i tolerated quite well the medication. my medical condition was the result of a disc herniation at l-s level, with no compression of the nerve root, besides use of nsaids, muscle relaxants, and neurontin, i had little response. i underwent also phisiotherapy, ultrasonograpy and other therapy. i have to say that finally i decided to receive alternative therapy (accupunture) and started practising qi gong and that in a few weeks i abandoned all medication and the pain began to ameliorate to a total recovery. 
i still believe that drugs are effective and are indicated in specific conditions, but i also know that not everybody responds in the same way to medication."
1,"lowers blood pressure and helps prevent strokes. helps the patient to function without the tingling, headaches, and chest pain that comes from having blood pressure too high. the only side effects i felt was a drained feeling when my blood pressure went down. i take one  mg benicar in the evening because that is when my blood pressure comes up. if i wake up in the middle of the night and my blood pressure is up again from my sleep apnea, then i take another half. i have to drink a lot more water too, as this helps the benicar to break down quicker."

1,decreased blood glocose levels. decreased appitite. less cravings for carbohydrates. loose stools in first week of treatment. minor stomach upset for first day or two of treatment. all side effects mild and transient. treatment once a day at night. evidence suggests that glucophage/metformin mimics the biological effect of calorie restriction for life extension.
1,"i began taking this medication during a very unstable period in my life and when i had been rapid cycling and experiencing mixed states, and over a  yr period it greatly helped increase my self-worth and overall stability. it helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions i was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. i still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. i even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. while on the medication i feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if i still feel down or up i am more confident in my ability to manage it. i feel like i am not overly leveled out and blah like i felt with depakote, more like i avoid the worst and can be in control. after  years and stopping for several months then starting again, i developed a rash which my psych guessed was the lamictal, although i don't understand why it started suddenly after so long! i convinced him to let me try again, however if i develop another rash i'll be switching to zyprexa. taken consistently for  years along w lexapro varying from  to  mg. occasionally risperdal as well."
1,"pain, (which was not controlled by acetaminophen w/codeine #), was reduced to a manageable state with ketorolac. constipation and loss of appetite, which were of little consequence, but the nausea was problematic. pepto-bismol tablets were used to try to control the nausea. three dental implants were being implanted into the front, lower jawbone to anchor a bridge replacing  lower incisors and  lower canine teeth."
0,"less depression/anxiety weight gain of  pounds -- very distressing. i stopped taking the lexapro and have been trying to manage my depression on my own with yoga, light therapy, supplements which has only been mildly effective."
1,"the ointment kept the symptoms of the dermatitis(i.e. itching, scaling and cracking) to a minimum.  as long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective. when i fell behind on the regular application of the ointment, the dermatitis would flare up within - days.  unfortunately, the ointment fails to ""cure"" the problem and only treats the symptoms. the application is very simple.  just apply the ointment to the affected area(bottoms of my feet) twice a day.  the dr. recommended i exfoliate the area regularly to remove any build-up of skin.  following that recommendation i would use a pumice stone - times a week prior to applying the treatment."
0,"the paxil relieved my anxiety and mild panic attacks at first. after time my doctor needed to increase the dose to get the same effect. the side affects were that i needed an abnormal amount of sleep.  the higher the dose the more time i slept.  also my blood pressure went up and i gained a lot of wieght. i started with half a mg pill a day. it was the increased to a full mg a day.  i then went to a mg and a half pill a day. then went to mg a day.
i then went off paxil entirely. my blood pressure went down and i lost a good anount of wieght but not all that i had gained. i did have some very high axiety at first but then it subsided."
1,"regular use of retin a cleared my acne dramatically. initially, i experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. this lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. within about six weeks, i would guess my skin was % clearer. over the past twelve years, i have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. one important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse. redness and mild to moderate irritation initially. photosensitivity (use a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen). seasonal changes can increase dryness. cleanse face with a mild soap each night. while skin is still wet, apply retin a (pea sized amount will cover entire face). allow to air dry completely. wash off in am, pat dry, and apply moisturizer/sunscreen."
1,"total recouperation from a long battle with acid reflux and stomach pains. absolutely none.  this medication is so much better than taking antacid tablets day after day and meal after meal. following my initial dose of the medication it would take several hours for my symptoms to subside. they did subside in the first days but would return after about  hours or so.  after about a week of daily dosing my acid reflux did not return regularly and my stomach pains subsided as well.  by the end of week  i was symptom free. after i stopped my course of treatment many weeks went by with no return of symptoms. since then, i have had one flare up.  i restarted my course of treatment with the same results and now have been close to a year symptom free.  i am very, very happy with nexium."
1,"alleviated my despair, gave me back some control of my emotions and motivated me to work harder at managing my depression and get out of the house. may have contributed to my insomnia. before i started taking effexor i had tried lexapro and cymbalta with unsatisfactory results.  having weaned off those, it was hard just to get out of bed - i was missing work and couldn't hold it together at all.  within a couple of days of taking this i started to feel better.  it's been the best so far at managing my depression but i still needed other drugs to help with mood swings and anxiety.  overall a good payoff, just wish it was generic!"
0,"this was recommended to me instead of gaviscon.  supposedly it was a better solution for my indigestion.  instead it was a disaster. terrible terrible.   i already suffer from constipation, but i took one of these tablets, as prescribed, for two consecutive days.  after two days i knew they were a no-no for me.  my innards came to a complete stop. i shall throw the remainder of the tablets away.  four days on my innards are still at a standstill. take one per day.

i have stopped taking them.  don't forget i already take dulcolax for my constipation, had i known these recommended tablets had a side effect of constipation i would have refused them.

it is back to the gaviscon for me, it is gentle, pleasant to take and liquid.
shell-like capsules and me do not get along."
1,"the benefit was a reduction the fatigue that i was feeling on a daily basis. there are no noticeable side effects, other than that if i am lapse in taking it, i feel extremely tired. the treatment plan is one pill daily, the prescription comes in monthly doses and is renewed indefinitely. regular blood test are done to test the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood system."
1,"after weeks of use, i did see a considerable decrease in pimples on my face.  being in my 's, i saw a benefit in my skin tone also. the cream is very drying, despite putting a moisturizer on after it.  in the winter, i sometimes cannot use it on a daily basis since my skin will peel.  in addition, i have to make sure the cream goes no where near my eye area, since my eyes will tear the next day if the cream gets within  inch from my eye.  the cream makes a person more sun sensitive also; however, i always wear a  sunscreen.  i cannot use on my neck since i got a rash every time i tried.  the side effects are far less than any of the oral medications my dermatologist tried with me. after washing my face and allowing it to dry, i apply the retin-a in small amounts over my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead.  i use it every night, except when my skin is peeling too much from use.  then i either switch to every other night, or put a moisturizer on first (incidentally, my dermatologist said the retin-a should be put on first, under the moisturizer).  i rarely ever get pimples in the areas i use the product.  even though there are some side effects, the benefits outweigh that."
1,"my headaches were less frequent, less severe, my pmdd symptoms decreased drastically. when coming off of the drug, my eyes hurt (felt like there was pressure on my eye-balls), had severe dizzy and nauseau. i was given the drug to take once a day to help with severe migraines that were triggered due to stress and severe pms symptoms."
0,"i could not observe any benefits: my blackheads remained as they were, and acne remained. probably my problem was not severe enough to see the results, however, due to no observed change i stopped using it. i have not noticed any side effects. though i am susceptible to various allergies, i have not had any breakouts or worsening effects. also, blackheads and acne did not become any worse. i was prescribed to use  cream gels - duac and tazorac. i was using small amount of each: duac as night cream, and tazorac as a day cream."
0,"the pain was greatly diminished and i was able to live my life in relative comfort. it caused my liver function tests to become elevated.  this was discovered by accident on a routine physical. i was taken off the diclofenac to see if that was the cause of the elevated liver enzymes; the tests were repeated about  weeks later.  they came back normal once the drug was out of my system.  i went back to suffering a great deal of pain and was sent to physical therapy, which didn't help.  i ended up having a nerve block done for the spinal problem, which has fixed the pain.  the other disseminated pain i have, was later treated very successfully with tramadol,  mg., two x daily, plus gabapentin,  mg, one x daily."

1,"i used to have at least  herpes outbreaks in the course of a year. these would interfere with personal time with my spouse, backpacking trips, day to day comfort.  in the time i have taken valtrex i have not had one outbreak, and don't have to think about it any longer. in the first weeks - i would have frequent low grade headaches, and a generally tired feeling.  but after i got used to the medication i didn't have any side effects. took one mg pill every morning.  that's it."
1,"i felt relaxed, could sleep, good drug to be lazy on. if i felt panicky and wanted to relax i could. i don't have alot of benefits to say because i think the grouchiness outweighs the good side effects to me! very grouchy! to the point i wanted to argue with people. just felt on edge, relaxed if i laid around but get up and do something just mean and grouchy! i seem to want to eat more too when i first started it. not when taken but craved sweets. / a pill twice daily for  days and / a pill when anxious. this treatment was to make sure i didn't get panicky and could relax. i did feel relaxed but grouchy!"

1,"completely stopped hot flashes and night sweats. (i think there was also some mild improvement in skin thickness as well but it certainly did not end cellulite!) initially took full strenth tabs and i did experience some menstrual bleeding as a result. this did not happen with the hs tabs.

on the other hand, thanks to the increased amount of tetosterone in the full strenght tabs, my interest in sex improved on these. not so much with the half strength tabs. i had a salivary estrogen level test done while i was on this medication. although it completely stopped menopausal symptoms my estrogen levels were still very low. so i'm not particularly concerned about adverse effects of estrogen treatment on these..."
1,"it took the ""edge"" off the pain, for sure.  without the medication i don't know how i could have put up with it. i was so out of it from the one pill, mouth hanging open, drooling, to take i had to cut it in half.  i also experienced digestive distress, and overall yucky feeling, not some blissfully pain free state. my arm was shattered..the bone was separated about / an inch at the upper arm, and a crack ran down a few inches to another break.  it was excruciating, but the / pill was enough to dull the pain to the point where i could sleep, and make it up to go to the restroom. the vicodin was for the pain of the broken arm.  the arm was in a plastic type of cast and sling.  after  weeks i was able to remove the sling but the shoulder had ""frozen"" by then so the physio required was just as painful!"
1,"less pain in joints and back. was able to do activities with my daughter  again. i stopped taking it for about  weeks and noticed a significant increase in pain. when i resumed taking it and symptoms faded. i had no noticable side effects. i was warned that there could be possible stomach upset, and if this were to occur then i should take with food. three tablets daily."
1,the benefits of taking all these asthma medications is that i have been pretty much symptom free.  the flovent has been particularly helpful in preventing flareups of my symptoms which has greatly reduced the need for my albuterol.  the benefits of taking the keppra is that i have only had one seizure episode since i began treatment in .  the episode lasted only seconds. i have no side effects from taking my asthma medications.  i experienced a lack of enery or just feeling tired when i first started taking the keppra in the morning.  i do not have that system any longer. i take my asthma medications daily and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.  the same is true for my seizure medication.
1,"noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  if the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  when the lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within / an hour.  the patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life. erectile function seemed to be mildly affected by this drug.  sexual performance became slightly more challenging once the patient began taking this medication and was noticeably improved when the patient missed a dose. lipitor was administered in pill form.  the patient received the prescription from a sliding scale clinic.  the patient also received a cardiogram, which revealed a % blockage.  alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise are the primary barriers to this patient's health improvement.  he consumes an average of ~ alcoholic beverages per day.  his diet includes many whole grains and vegetables, but also a large amount of fat and cholesterol.  the patient exercises sparatically and becomes fatigued quickly during physical activity.  patient smoked for several years, but quit approximately  years ago."

1,"it started working immediately which was wonderful.  my energy level increased, i was more interested in going out rather than hiding in my house.  i've increased to mg x's a day.  i've lost approximately  pounds but i think that's because of an interaction from the concerta & lamotrigine. within  months i noticed my eyes felt strained all the time so i continually have to refocus.  i get tremors in my hands every couple days and can't stop them from shaking.  the worst - and the reason i'm choosing to change medications is the excessive sweating.  i use clinical strength deodorant x's per day but i can't go through the summer being self conscious of how i smell.  i constantly check my arm pits for sweat marks. i started out with mg and moved quickly up to mg per day.  i increased to mg but found no benefit so i dropped back down mg.  if i didn't have the sweating side effect i would definitely continue to take this drug."
1,"until  days ago never took an anti-depressant, gp encouraged me due to my fatigue, low mood, agitation and within - days i found myself much more laid back and smiling at people more, usually because something is said and i see a funny side to it.  i know it ism supposed to take  weeks to work but i am changed or else back to myself.  my husband is pleased as i have stopped shouting at him at the least thing.  i have more energy and much more optimistic palpitations at times, slight dizziness but decreasing each day mg per day"

1,it effectively treated my maxillary sinus infection.  no more smelly nasal discharge and i could see the result within the first day of taking this drug. no major side effects i could tell except a constant mild headache that did not really bother much. i have had a maxillary sinus infection after a flu for  weeks and it would not go away.  the nasal discharge had a very unpleasant smell and taste.  my doctor first prescribed cefuroxime mg and i took that for  days with no results.  i then went to my dentist to have my teeth checked to see if they might have been the cause.  the dentist found nothing but prescribed biaxin mg for me to take for the infection.  the smelly nasal discharge decreased substantially after the first day of taking this antibiotic!  i continued to take this for   days and the sinus infection is gone and no more smelly mucus coming out of my nose.

i am very annoyed about the bad press surrounding use of xanax as myself and others who have been prescribed the medication can use it in a mature manner.generally people of good judgement and living clean lifestyles are at little risk for addiction.xanax was produced to help with specific problems possibly due to chemical inbalances in brain or traumas."

0,"the treatment benefits were marginal at best.  mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that ssris are only effective in the most severe of cases. on the plus side, i experienced no major side effects.  the possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  however, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal. the pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  the prescribing physician recommended taking lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects."

i used to only get migraines once or twice a month. a bit tired feeling...sort of lathargic or weak feeling.
here is the bad for me. since taking imitrex, the frequency of migraines have increased. i got rebound from this drug everytime i use it. it'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but i cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. i've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but i can no longer take it. again about the rebound effect. some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. i took nothing else...no otc drugs or anything else for the headach. only the imitrex. when i realized what was happening i stopped taking drug and just suffer through as i used to. that's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less."

1,"sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  easy to take, just one pill a day! i had no side effects with this drug!  i loved it. vyvanse is a new medication used to treat adhd.  it is a time-released capsule.  it is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  i took one mg pill in the morning.  the pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  this allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. i did not have any of the normal adhd med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  the only downside to this medication is the cost.  since vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  i paid $/month for  pills! i was self-pay though, so i'm sure having insurance would be ideal! although it is very expensive, it is well worth it."

one  day prescription of .mg pills can last anywhere from two months to six months. as needed works great for me as when i know my heart starts racing and the adrenaline starts pumping for no reason, half of .mg pill will offset that attack. i am also a smoker so reduced % absorption, is enough to stop the panic. i do not take this medication daily and have not for over  years. i only use it when i can not control the imbalance, if i can not lower my heart rate with breathing etc., i will then take a half which brings it under control.

1,"climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. it also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). the side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch. the only side effect from the climara is mild itching after removing the patch. another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone i have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my ibs - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. so i take the progesterone only  days/month now and the side effects are minimal. after being miserable with frequent (+ times/day, - times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, i went on hormone replacement therapy. estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so i went on the patch, which i have to change only once a week. the recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but i found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my ibs symptoms. to lessen that effect, i went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only  days/month. this is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but i feel much better overall because my ibs symptoms are much less severe and less frequent."

1,"i took this medication to treat restless leg syndrome and it was very effective. it made me drowsy at first, but once i took it for a few weeks, it just made my legs stay still so i could sleep.  i was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients, but at a much lower dose.  i did need to take a but more as time went on, but it was still effective.  unfortunately, i had to stop taking it when i got pregnant, since it is a category c medication. i did need to take more as time went on, and i experienced augmentation of the restless leg syndrome.  the symtpoms would begin earlier in the evening and i would try to take the medication sooner, because if i did not take it before the symptoms set in, it was much less effective and would take longer to work.  that was really the only unfortunate effect of the medication. i took one milligram at night to treat the symtoms of restless leg syndrome.  i had a sleep study which showed that my legs about every two minutes while i was sleeping and that brought me out of a deep sleep.  my doctor put me on requip to keep my legs still so i could fall asleep and get better rest.  it worked well.  i had tried all sort of behavioral remedies to help with my legs and nothing had helped until this medication.  i slept better than i ever had since i could really relax instead of waiting for the nightly discomfort in my legs."

1,"meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  it seems that this happens in two ways; first, i do feel full most of the time, even though i feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  the other part is that i just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  this is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  i just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  also, i have noticed that i when i am tempted to snack, i am able to see that i am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  it is not a miracle drug.  i still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  also, it took  and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  it did not help my hunger the first week.  just give it some time to build up in your body! at first i felt increased nervousness and anxiety.  after about ten days, it lifted my mood and began to take away my appetite.  then the nervousness went away.  it is harder for me to fall asleep and to sleep as deeply as before, but some of this happens when ever i loose weight. take first thing in the morning with breakfast.  i eat three meals with two snacks a day and drink loads of water and iced tea.  you have to drink enough for this drug to work.  you need way more water, as much as possible.  then you really will feel full most of the time."

1,"i had mono which went undiagnosed and that, along with other life stressors had me very sick and run down. i was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. i was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. i had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. my nausea all but disappeared. i only became nauseated when working nights. my anxiety level also somewhat decreased. i was very sleepy at first and would sleep up to  hours per day. i was also recovering from mono at the time, which may have contributed to my drowsiness. i felt a bit dazed at first as well. i took mg once a day at bedtime as it causes drowsiness and it could be increased to  mg although i never needed an increase. i took remeron to get rid of my nausea which was constant and severe and it worked. after  years i had a major crisis in my life and forgot to take my remeron for  days in a row. when i finally did take it i was incredibly tired and couldn't keep my eyes open all day. i felt stoned and the only factor that had changed had been the remeron. i decided to try stopping as i had not suffered from that severe nausea since starting remeron. it has been  months and the nausea has not yet returned. i have no other side effects."
1,"my mood was stablized, and i was able to take advantage of cognitive therapy.  without the medication, i was not able to benefit from ct. mild sexual dysfunction;  nothing else. i took  mg. of prozac once per day, in one tablet.  it took about  weeks for the drug to reach its peak effectiveness, which is one of the drawbacks of this anti-depressant therapy.  i tried others, but they didn't work nearly as well as prozac."

1,"antacids were ineefeective to counteract severe pain and inability to eat. symptoms reduced within  hours and completely dissapeared within  days none acute ulcer was the result of diclofenac sodium taken for the aches and fever. very severe ulceration,pain required tramadole administration. inability to eat. antacids were ineffective nexium resolved the symptoms within  hours."
1,helped to prevent flare by arresting inflammation at the beginning of condition. it was in a cream formulation which made it easy to penetrate skin and ideal for a tropical climate. it was however not useful when the condition- eczema or dermatitis flared up. it is more useful in controlling inflammation at the beginning as opposed to a strong steroid cream used more as a rescue when condition has already flared and has become red and angry. none at st sign of pink and itchiness use sparingly and apply emollients over. once inflammation has seized stop elidel but continue emollients to help rebuild skin barrier function.
0,"this drug worked as a treatment for strep throat. behavioral changes including extreme irritability and aggressiveness. while these changes started while taking omnicef, they continued for months afterward. my daughter also developed food sensitivities. from careful observation, i surmise that this drug caused severe inflammation in her gut that we are treating with probiotics. we are seeing some improvement with avoiding foods such as milk and egg as well as diligently taking probiotics and vitamin c."
1,"i was able to breathe more freely after i took this medication and my peak flow meter readings were significantly higher. i did not notice any side effects. however, unless i positioned the inhaler very carefully, some of the medication ended up in my mouth rather than being inhaled. i was also using a q-var inhaler twice a day during the flare (i normally use it once a day.) my treatment regimen when i have a flare is q-var at  puffs twice a day, and the proair inhaler  puffs every four hours."
1,"muscle relaxation took about  days to be effective.  pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially, but after  days relief was found.  days was far better and - stopped taking every day. drowsiness was an issue, but this did improve the sleep time which reduced stress and allowed blood pressure to lower.  i do not like to take medicine, but i can see how easy it is to rely on these to feel relaxed and numb!  it is frightening when i hear about people taking these every night and not think about treating underlying cause of muscle tension. the two medicines were used in tandem to offset the excrutiating pain in neck and shoulders due to muscles spasms. chiropractic care was also used, but the pain was equivalent to childbirth contractions and after two days of no sleep and increased stress, medicine was sought.  the medicine took another two days to offer relief that allowed sleep, but after  days the muscles were relaxed. chiropactic care continued and yoga was restarted to resolve the underlying problems. after - days medication was stopped.  night of the following week required medication, but since, none needed."
1,"smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a vitamin a derivative and promote faster cell turnover. my skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too. skin sensitivity can increase if you use too much of the product. when it says apply a thin layer, it means a very small amount - it goes a long way! for me this  was the only real side effect. treatment is simple - after cleansing the face gently, apply a thin layer of the differin gel to the skin before applying anything else, in other words it should go underneath any moisturiser or any other product you are using so that it is in direct contact with the skin."
0,"taken daily, prevacid successfully reduced my acid stomach symptoms to the point that they did not occur. i did not need other over the counter remedies i had used in the past, such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared. unfortunately, i became woozy and suffered dizziness after taking the medication, often requiring that i lie down and or take a nap. after an initial period of a few hours, these symptoms subsided. side effects were sporadic and i tried initially to continue the medication due to its effectiveness. prevacid was prescribed for my symptoms of acid reflux, which included some stomach  upset and ""full"" feeling after eating.  although it was highly effective, i eventually discontinued use of prevacid due to side effects.  i am now using over the counter zantac successfully, only as needed, not daily. it should be noted that i am very sensitive to medication and often react to medications that are not a problem for others."

i have more vivid dreams. also has caused me to talk in my sleep and sometimes physically act out the dream while asleep. one night i was dreaming i was swimming and woke me and my boyfriend up because i was kicking my legs as if i were swimming. if i miss a dose and go to sleep it causes night sweats. if i miss a dose before bed i wake up with my clothes and hair soaked in sweat. i was started at .mg for a week. moved up to mg the next week. after a week at mg was then moved up to mg. i was then moved up a week later to mg. i took mg for about yrs. i had to cut back on the dose because i lost my job with insurance and could no longer afford mg prescriptions.
i tried to (without my doctors advice or knowledge) get off the medicine cold turkey when i lost my insurance. doing that made me extremely emotional. i would start crying for no reason at all and felt crazy! i went back to the doctor and talked about my situation. she set up a program to slowly take me off the medicine. i stepped down my dose by mg every  weeks till i got to mg. then i went to taking . for  weeks. then went to . every other day for a week. then . every third day and so on till i finally got down to none. i went  months off the medication before going back to the doctor to be put back on it. i have now been back on it for about a year now. i have no plans to ever stop taking it again."
1,"helped with depression - did nothing for anxiety i did help me with my fear of crowds. it also helped me with my hopelessness i had been encountering. anxiety - seemed to make me nervous and to make me irritable at times. it did not, however, decrease my appetite which is does for many people who take it. given for major depression.  one mg pill per day.  i still take the same dosage as i started out on.  i am afraid to up my dose because wellbutrin can cause seizures in many people."

1,"nexium  is very effective for me when i want to relieve heartburn. i don't take it everyday, only when i have the symptoms of heartburn due to acid reflux.  the treatment benefits were that my stomach felt better, and i didn't have acid reflux due to the foods i had ingested. i did not experience any symptoms. the way i use nexium is i take it every time a food doesn't sit well and causes acid reflux or i feel it'll cause  i take it."
0,"i saw a moderate decrease of inflammation in some cystic acne lesions.  in the case of mild acne that is not cystic, the risks outweigh the benefits if the injection is not done properly. i developed a prominent indentation on my face at one injection site.  this was caused by lipothrophy, or a shrinkage of the fat cells beneath my skin.  this usually resolves within - weeks.  sometimes it never goes away completely.  i have also been unusually irritable and anxious. a dermatological assistant injected what she assumed to be several adult acne cysts on my face with an unknown amount of kenalog .  about a week after one injection site developed an indentation the size of a pencil eraser. on a subsequent follow up visit the doctor told me that this would go away in two to four weeks.  in two weeks, i have seen no improvement.  i feel that the docor did not adequately explain the possible physical and emotional side effects of this very potent drug.  she never said that it was a steroid."
0,"i didn't receive any treatment benefits from this drug.  it actually made the symptoms worse with more resistance to antibiotics.  i ended up having to take a different, more powerful antibiotic.  i tried it two separate times with the same results both times. none that i could identify i was take this to deal with the infection in my chest."

1,"reduced excess acid and throat irritation, although not completely. bending over still causes bile in throat.  nighttime coughing still happens. certain foods definitely trigger irritation.  protonix was the last of  or  similar medications i tried (nexium, etc) and all others had much worse side effects (headaches and dry mouth particularly). mild nausea at first, gradually disappearing after about a month of treatment. basically  pill in the am and avoid triggering foods such as chocolate.  fortunately food triggers seem to be time-of-day sensitive. for instance, i can drink coffee but only in the am."

0,i'm not entirely sure it was effective at all. it was really difficult to quite taking effexor.  i had all kinds of panic attacks and severe depression when trying to quite.  i must have tried to quite a dozen times.  i think this is a dangerous drug. i took effexor once daily at bedtime for  years.
1,"eliminated the pain without the mental side effects of drugs like vicodin. seemed to be a very mild mood elevator, but that could just have been due to having my mood improved from not being in pain. for the first couple days of taking it i suffered moderate insomnia/waking up during the night. this went away over the course of treatment. after surgery, i was offered vicodin or percocet but do not like either because they cause me to be too foggy mentally. i initially tried just advil but that didn't work on the pain. the dr. prescribed generic ultram (tramadol). it took quite awhile for the first one to take effect (more than an hour) but it provided long-lasting pain relief. i was a bit leery of it because i read online that it can be addictive however, after  weeks i cut the dose to x a day instead of x and then after  weeks stopped entirely with no ill effects after that."

1,"retin-a smoothed out my skin and reduced fine lines. it particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  they virtually disappeared, and people remarked within a few months that i looked healthier, less tired, and younger.  i was happy with the results of using this product. irritated skin, dry skin. when i first started using this product, they gave me a weaker strength and i gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  the only problem was that if i used a little too much, even later as my skin was used to the formula, i would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.  i eventually moved to using topical ascorbic acid instead of retin-a, which works well and doesn't cause the skin irritation. i spread a dab or two of the cream on my face at night before sleeping.  it took several weeks to acclimate to the cream. it did improve the appearance of my skin. i noticed that it also made what the dermatologist called pre-cancerous spots disappear (these were a couple of small spots that the doctor wanted to treat with topical vitamin a)."
1,"i did notice right away a marked improvement in my insomnia and no longer require the clonazepam.  i too felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and my disposition improved.  i felt much better than i had in years.  little aches and pains in my lower back and hips which i've been treating throught the chiropractor, became more tolerable.  my husband was pleased and thinks i'm much easier to live with.  i didn't realize how grouchy and difficult i had become. i have trouble waking and getting up in the morning.  my lips are very dry and nothing seems to help.  my mouth is also dry first thing in the morning, but improves as the day progresses.  i yawn excessively.  i don't have as much energy, i have to force myself to take an evening walk. dr initially told me he thought my insomnia was depression.  i was desparate.  the sleep deprivation was making it hard to function at work and home.  i agreed to take  mg of citalopram.  my insomnia didn't completely subside, so i still was taking clonazepam . mg about every other night.  after a month, the dr upped the prescription to  mg.  i slowly made the transition from  to  then  mg."

1,"a very good nights sleep is one of the benefits, found out that the sedative effects are actually increased in the lower doses.  i lowered my dosage and live the sound sleep.  it knocked out my delusions and hallucinations, hopefully for good. weight gain is the worst side effect, but a small price to pay for sanity. i actually ended up with motion disorders from all the other meds, the worst one being parkinsons for over a year.  i had to take parkinsons drugs. it was so scary drooling all the time and looking stone faced, no expression.  i dont feel any signs of this with the seroquel."

1,"face cleared up in weeks.about  mths. i started in the end of november and by mid february my face was extremely clear. i stop using it after my face cleared up, wrong thing to do. once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear. i got a whole lot of bumps on my face from using heavy amount of retin-a on my face. you only need to use a little to get the job done. it's very strong and needs to be put on very lightly on the bumps. excessive retin-a will cause you to look worse! i love rein-a only because it grabs everything from underneath the surface and brings it out. it really works but takes time and patience. i would always stick to retin-a and never change because it gets the job done and theres no turning back."

i was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  i feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  i was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  my only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  all the time.  it is generally easy to ignore during the day, but i have found that i need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep. it did make me mildly nauseous for the first day that i was on it. after that, all good.  it made my hands very shaky for awhile, but that seems to have subsided for the most part, particularly since i cut my caffeine intake.  given that it's an amphetamine derivative, it make since that adding another stimulant might lead to side effects.

0,"i didn't feel the urge as much as i did before the medication, but they were still there. nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams i built up the dosage like i was supposed to and took the twice daily dose for two days.  i spent both of those days unable to move because of the nausea, so my doctor recommended i drop down to . mg a day. on that small dosage i became very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts as well as very vivid dreams.  i went off the drug and then tried it again a few months later only to have the same depression issues. i'd rather keep smoking and try to find a new way to quit than to lose my life on this drug."

1,"i go to sleep within an hour and a half of taking it. i even get up to use the toilet around  am and i have no problem falling back asleep. tried ambien for  months, but i had to keep upping the dose and i still couldn't sleep. plus ambien made my anxiety worse. now my anxiety is gone and i am generally more content with life.

0,"less flair ups of the crohns disease. less diarhea and cramping. no side effects evidentent i believe you mean the treatment of the disease. for me it was taking my medication asacol, and watching my diet. i understand foods have different effects on different individuals. for me, avoiding foods high in fat, avoiding excessive sugars and high fiber foods (popcorn, nuts) made the difference for me. the drug w/o diet would not work.

should stress be factored, that too, weighed heavily."
1,"our home was destroyed in the  northridge earthquake. before the earthquake, i was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. after the earthquake, my doctor recommended i give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. about two weeks later, i found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. the ""old me"" was back! 

thanks to the medication, i was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them. the sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the zoloft. my husband and i found it very frustrating that i was unable to reach climax where before, i had been multi-orgasmic. because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that i found to be unacceptable.  my inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. my libido came to a screeching halt. this depressed both of us so i gradually weaned myself off the zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

one other thing about taking the zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; i found myself living life somewhere in the middle. in addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. i was, in essence, comfortably numb.

other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions. my primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, zoloft. the plan was to take the medication for three to six months until i felt i was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

i started with  mg every other day for five days, then  mg a day for one week, followed by  mg a day every day thereafter. i began therapy with a psychologist once a week where i was diagnosed with ptsd. strangely enough, i found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. i did not find that to be helpful at the time. had i not been on anti-depressants before i went to counseling, i would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that i had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place."
1,"the benefits were, i was taking it for excessive prolong spotting and bleeding. slowly but surely everything did go back to normal, no more excessive bleeding or spotting but it did take like  months. the side effect for me was weight gain and depression. treatment was to be ongoing for six months to treat condition. i was to take it  days out of the month. during treatment i had break-through bleeding and very bad cramping, though i do not think directly connected with treatment. i gained weight, but soon took off through walking running and other activities. i went through a very bad depression, resulting in me taking another medication for treament of that. it wasn't until i went off treatment until everything got back to ""normal"" (no more excessive bleeding or spotting in between periods)."

i took this drug for  year and  months. the anxiety and depression affected me almost immediately although i was completely clueless as to the cause. i cycled through every single anti-depressant and adhd medication trying to solve this problem. it wasn't until i stopped the medication that i realized it was the propecia. these side effects have not subsided at all seven months later! i would not wish this on my worst enemy. this drug has literally destroyed my life. i know that no one wants to lose their hair and look unattractive, but just imagine how attractive you will be if you are one of the unfortunate few of us that gets gynecomastia, penile fibrosis, and inability to ejaculate (i cannot even mastrubate to orgasm after taking this drug). if you value your life then i strongly suggest you find some other way!  pill per day"

0,"the upper and lower eyelashes grew longer, thicker, and darker.  there is less need for mascara or eyelash curlers with this product.  lumigan contains the same active ingredient that latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  it does work. i developed dark under eye circles, itching, redness and a slight headache after each use but i was told that the under eye circles and headaches i experienced were less common side effects.  once the treatment was stopped all of the side effects disappeared including the dark under eye circles. also, once the treatment is stopped the eyelashes eventually return to their original state. i was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  it is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  i used a new eyelash brush daily and latisse contains once a day applicators."
1,"the retin-a seems to have minimized some of my fine lines, and has helped clear my pores, greatly reduced blackheads and minimized white-heads, and almost erradicated cystic blemishes altogether.  i believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results i have seen thust far. i have been fortunate to have only experienced minimal irritation.  initially, i had tightness, dry feeling on my face, with some peeling or shedding.  this subsequently caused some itching, but, again, no irritation or pain.  i noticed when applied to active blemishes, the blemish seemed to worsen, become redder,and seemed like it wouldn't heal, but i have combated that by adding a good, natural moisturizer into my routine after the application. i started using . % retina-a every evening after cleansing, but making sure my face was completely dry.  only a small amount of the cream was needed.  i applied it carefully, avoiding lips and inner eye area.  afterwards, i used a non-greasy, non-comedogenic moisturizer to minimize dryness, flaking and irritation."
1,"i recently saw my pcp for my annual exam and had  major concerns to discuss with her.  the first was some depression issues and the second was that i had recently developed indoor allergies.  as is standard my pcp recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and claritin (hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  the problem is that i am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  on the other hand, my md approved claritin although i was nursing.  at the end of the session she told to to start on claritin and come back for the antidepressants once i weened my son.  so i started the claritin and my depression abated.  all of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  since i started taking claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  i feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  in terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  regardless, i am happy with the product.

i share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if claritin is approved by your md for use while nursing, why not try it?  or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds. it ended my year long depression. please see above."

1,"alleviated depression without lethargy, weight gain, a paradoxical effect, or sexual dysfunction.  prozac made me suicidally depressed. mao-inhibitors like parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- i went from smoking a pack of camels a day to not smoking. i often would get pounding headaches, in the front of my skull and at the sides, especially as the day wore on.  i also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day, which would be exacerbated by coffee.  i got tremors. occasionally i'd get migaines. i took   mg of the wellbutrin, mg of ritalin and a  mg of a beta blocker (i can't remember the name) in the morning.  then at  i took the other  mg of the wellbutrin; at night i took the serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the trazodone.  i took a drug holiday from the ritalin over the weekend, but over the years i eventually increased the dosage to mg of ritalin in the morning."

1,"my conclusions of the medication are that it has definately lessened the amount of migraine headaches that i was encountering. i have not had to have an emergency hospital visit in almost a year. this went from a visit occuring almost every other month with horrible painful headaches in between this time. i still get headaches which are tollerable, and if i have a migraine have not had to go to the hospital for pain relief. it has been tolerable. i have now gotten my dose down to mg at night time only and am still having the same benefit. my only side effect were some memory difficulty in the beginning. i drove to my doctors office and became disoriented. rather than panic i laughed it off and pulled over and had to think about where i was going.

1,"once i started using the inhaler it greatly reduced night time waking with asthma symptoms. early morning breathing became easier instead of tight breathing.  my use of a rescue inhaler specifically, proventil, was cut down from several times a night to usually . i only use my rescue inhaler occassionally now instead of routinely.  my life has changed with advair, i highly recommend it! when i first started it, i noticed a little bit of nervousness, this only lasted a few days, and with continued use, i am no longer having any side effects.  i have never experienced any of the lung infections the package insert speaks of, nor have i ever had sudden asthma symptoms after using the advair inhaler. one inhalation of the advair inhaler in the morning and one again at bedtime."

1,the eye infection symptoms went away in about two days. my eye had been swollen shut. i had tried some over the counter with no results when i visited the doctor. he hesitated using it due to misuse from patients however my symptoms were so severe he made it happen for me. i had no side effects with this treatment. visit to the doctor. diagnosis estimate made. prescription made and finally cure happened.

0,"blood pressure was controlled with the same dose as the former drug i used, micardis. my insurance would not cover it and i started using fosinopril. i didnt think i had adverse effects from it until someone pointed out my dry constant cough. i developed a dry cough and it seemed to get persistently worse as months went by. i didnt realize the cough could be a side effect from the drug, but as soon as i replaced it with benicar, the symptons disappeared. i took the drug once daily in the morning and outwardly i felt no discomfort at all. blood pressure was controlled. i took this drug approximately one year before starting benicar and losing the symptom of coughing."
0,"initial dose was highly effective for pain relief.  it took effect within  minutes and lasted several hours. no side effects were experienced while taking it. vicodin and ibuprofin were prescribed together for the management of pain. the initial dose was highly effective and lasted several hours, however, each subsequent dose resulted in only moderate pain relief and produced a ""foggy"" feeling.  i do not feel that i would have been capable of driving while taking vicodin.  i would most likely not take it again."
1,"clear headed, able to complete projects without procastination, % help with short-term memory, lessened depression and anxiety, no more obsessive eating, weight loss... dry mouth (which is great because i now drink a lot of water instead of sodas because the sodas don't quinch my thirst) i have been on antidepression meds for  years, but my depression persisted regardless of the treatment.  i used to sleep - hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  i was diagnosed with sleep apnea  years ago, but even sleeping with cpap did not help with my daytime fatigue.  after seeing many family practitioners, i finally broke down and invested in a very well educated psychiatrist who diagnoed me with add since childhood.  his decision to prescribe vyvanse was brilliant!  i feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  for the first time in as long as i can remember, i can think normally!  no more racing thoughts in my head, and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  i do still take an antidepressive, but i am certain that the vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  i can finally sleep a normal  to  hours and still be awake and alert throughout my -hour work days.  i was worried that the vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level, but the opposite occured!  my anxiety is all but absent, and i no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  there is no substitute for a doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  spend the money and see!  a good psychiatrist will spend hours with you before making a diagnosis, and if adult add is what you have, then give vyvanse a try.  it worked great for me and my live has turned around for the better.  it is the best remedy that i have found in  years!  you must take it when you awaken for your day, because it takes about - hours to get out of your system.  if you take it later in the day - you will experaince insomnia.  ask your specialist about vyvanse..."
1,"relief of symptoms of interstitial cystitis, including pain and frequency of urination initially - feeling of wooziness, nausea, tiredness.  this wore off after - weeks. relieved my symptoms of  interstitial cystitis significantly after  year or so on the drug.  even within  months it greatly reduced the pain associated with the disease and decreased the number of times i had to use the bathroom from   per day to < per day. with continued use, i believe it helped reduce inflammation/mast cell production in my bladder, and along with dietary changes and treatment for infections to my bladder wall lining caused by lyme disease related organisms, elmiron allowed my bladder to heal to some degree, reducing my symptoms further and my incidence of urinating to < times per day on average."
1,"when i was first on the  mg dosage, there was no apparent benefit. when the dosage was upped to  mg, there was dramatic reductio of the edema. then i had mitral valve surgery and took no furosemide for a while, but eventually the edema returned and the  mg dosage helps some. (see side effects) i am not aware of any most of the time. however, after my surgery they kept me on  mg and i began having dizziness and severe general malaise in the mornings after taking it. (see treatment details.) when i began having the side effects after surgery, the doctor took me off of the furosemide and the side effect immediately disappeared, and i also had no edema for a few weeks. the doctor then put me back on the  mg dosage, which i still take. it seems to help sometimes, but not all of the time."

0,"no benefit severe nausea, periods of headache, loss of appetite, horrible taste in mouth (it woke me up  times at night), loss of taste had an ongoing yeast infection that would not go away. so the dr is trying this med.  it is terrible.  the pharmacist said any use of perfume, mouthwash or anything with any type of alcohol makes the side effects much worse.  i don't use any of those things so he said discontinue use and contact physician."
0,"slight eurphoria and ""high"" felt good but not what i was trying to treat aggravated acne, short term memory loss, loss of cognitive abilities most recently diagnosed with adult add, never tried add medications before. tried to give it time to work as many people say side effects get better but could not deal with the major facial skin breakouts."
1,decreased number of spasms and pain associated with the spasms. the only side effect i have experienced was apin over my entire body due to weaning off the medication. nuerontin must be weaned off very carefully with the help of a pcp. i first started on mg a day and the next day i could feel aldifference in my body. i had less fatigue and my spasms were not as extreme as they had been. my specialist increased my dose to mg x a day. i have been on the dose for  yrs and have had little to no neck and shoulder spasms.  i wish i had know about this treatment yrs ago.  i would have lived in a pain free environment and would have been much happier.

1,"cleared the condition completely.   augmentin worked after other antibiotics did not.   the infection was resistant to other antibiotics. stomach upset at times from augmentin.  otherwise not really any reaction. two pills at  mg a day.  this lasted for a month.  again my bronchial infection was resistant, or the doctor said i'd come down with the infection again [this happened in the spring two years ago, when there was a very resistant virus or infection going around and people were coming down with an infection again].  after two weeks of a regular antibiotic [azithroymicin] i was not getting better so the doctor put me on augmentin.  it completely zapped what i had and i got over it."
0,"the nexium was effective in stopping my heart burn. i had severe side effects.  i itched all over, broke out in hives.  i had chest pain and swelling of the lips and eyes.  i had to immediately take benedril to stop the drug reactions.  i felt nausiated for days after the adverse drug reaction. i had been taking prevacid for years with success and no adverse drug reactions. i had to switch because my insurance would not pay for the prevacid any more because there was a generic form of prevacid.  i tried the generic but it was not effective so i was given the prescription for nexium.  the nexium was effective but i was highly allergic to it."

1,"differin does help reduce the number of pimples for an acne patient.  it did not eliminate them in my case, but reduced them by about %. dryness and flakiness were the two most common side effects that i experienced. in addition, my skin became more sensitive to environmental stresses like wind, cold, and sun.  consequently my face often appeared flush. i used a non-soap cleanser to wash my face twice daily.  in the morning, i followed this with an application of persa gel and then a sunscreen.  in the evening after washing my face, i would apply a moisturizer, then the differin, and then spot treated pimples with persa gel."
1,"i noticed that i was feeling better and my menstrual cycle was more regular. my skin cleared up as well and i felt more energetic. there are times that i would feel nauseous and diarrhea. another thing that bothered me with this medicine is the smell of the pills, it made me really nauseous and disgusted, i have to plug my nose to take them. if you do not eat right and take the medicine, i think there is no point. my advice would be to eat healthy, exercise (even if you just walk) and take this medicine you will see results."
1,"immediate ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.  no side effects in the morning. i have to take the drup on an empty stomach.  very bad side effects if taken with alcohol.  taken alone, side effects were increased night eating and loss of memory after taking the medication.  if you do not go to sleep immediately you may drive or do things without using good sense. treatment is . miligrams for an indefinate period of time."
0,"chantix was incredibly effective for the purpose of smoking cessation. while users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking, i felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively, making smoking absolutely repellent, that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort. vivid dreams, often lasting throughout the night, not necessarily disturbing, as some have reported, but (seemingly) long, deep, and realistic. perhaps for this reason, i did not awake feeling well-rested while taking the drug. significant loss of appetite occurred, but sugary foods seemed more appealing. mood became depressed to the point that suicidal thoughts occurred. began taking a low-dose as part of the ""starter pack."" desire to smoke diminished quickly and was gone within only a few days. dose gradually increased to  .mg tablets/day. continued with this dosage for close to two months at which time i stopped taking the drug due to the side effects listed above. have since started smoking again."
1,"i have used this drug for several months. for me it lasts a long time, even into the next morning, but it seemed to take longer, on me anyway, than viagra did, more like  hours before it worked at all. i would recommend this to anyone that does not need it to take effect quickly. i have not seen any side effects at all with lavitra i was having a difficult time maintaining an erection, however this works great. i am very pleased."
1,"i am finally able to focus, concentrate on tasks, and able to stay on track at work. before vyvanse - i jumped from task to task without completing one prior to starting another. loss of appetite, anxiety when vyvanse was wearing off. i have no side effects at present. prescribed for adult add. i take one per day - mg."

1,"taken at a stage where puss filled blisters were swollen, ensured a quick and painless transition from this stage to a stage where blisters became dry. not much effect for  days or so, however when the blisters did dry up they did so quickly and was not painful at all which is what i had expected. fairly easy to apply and good consistency for application. none applied directly onto affected area  times a day. chose to apply generously and cover effected area with a bandage."
0,"i was not willing to deal with the effects of the drug three times a day and so i discontinued use. there were no side effects -- but the expected effects were very intense -- a hot flush that moved from my face to my legs, and itching on my arms, legs, back, and torso. niacin taken in such a large dose opens the capillaries. this increases the blood flow close to the skin and releases histamines. the resulting hot flush and itching lasts for about  minutes.  it is an interesting experience, but three times a day is a bit much, especially during my at work dose. the red face was alarming my customers and the itching was a bit too distracting."
0,"it did clear up the infection even in the time frame i used it. i had severe stomach cramps and rapid heart beat.  seemed to make me feel very thirsty and somewhat faint feeling.  did not feel well at all.  my coughing and infection dramatically subsided, however, the side effects made me feel so badly i quit taking it. this was prescribed to me for possible whooping cough...due to exposure to pertusis through my daughter.  even though my older daughter had received the pertusis vaccine she still was finally diagnosed as having whooping cough.  it took several doctors to finally catch what she had.  in the meantime she was very sick...had several z-packs and failed to respond.  i came down with a bad cold shortly thereafter and as a precaution i was given the erythromycin [different doctor than the one she went to]."
1,increased ability to cope extremely bad stomach burning support during life stress
1,"this drug blocked the receptors for nicotine, so the cravings were extremely diminished. the dosage was increased over a week, so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly. the worst side effect was nausea.  when i reached the twice daily dose, i was nauseated most of the day. it was much better when i cut the pills in half and took them several times a day with plenty of liquid and food.  the other side effect is constipation. a low dose of a laxitive is helpful with this. i have quit smoking many times.  this time with chantix has been the smoothest. 
the physical withdrawal was easier than times in the past.  i was somewhat irritable for a few days, but nothing severe.  the nausea and constipation were annoying, but i was able to work around them. the mental obsession of this addiction is still present at times, but no pill is going to make that go away. it has gotten easier with time."
1,"greatly helps depression and mood. very effective for obsessive thinking/ fear.   stopped depression and there are very few anxieties.  regained appetite. all emotions dulled, sexual numbness, flatulance, weight gain of % over normal weight, fatigue, loss of motivation and a bit scattered thinking.  does not help sleeping difficulties. very slow paced withdrawal, over a  month period needed to avoid the side effects of withdrawal.  included effects of quitting are- brain zaps, noise sensitivity, jittery/ jumpy.  with slow withdrawal few side effects ( brain zaps).  mg a day from day  for  years.  quit  years ago.  started paxil again feb  at  mg per day for  week,  mg per day for  months and back to  mg per day.  quitting with slow withdrawal presently.  now taking  mg every other day for past  wks.  starting to feel more alive and less sexual side effects."
1,"i suffered chronic pain and sleep disruption because of the pn of unknown cause (not diabetes).  i also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  i still have pain,sometimes better,sometimes worse, but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously. the gabapentin, which i was taking long before cymbalta, made me sleepy, but on the day after a night of disrupted sleep, the fatique can be overwhelming.  also, for the first six months or so, i had a lot of gas and stomach rumblings.  when i first started on cymbalta, i felt very spacey and light-headed but that passed after a couple of weeks.  my internist thinks my blood pressure is up slightly because of the cymbalta i take cymbalta in combination with  mg gabapentin and  mg elavil."
0,reduction in alopecia progression which began at age . alopecia was very agressive through s until procecia introduction. since then the condition has been slowed although not stopped. testicular discomfort at onset with a decrease in semen production. no other noticeable effects worth noting. taken orally once a day. usually at night.
1,"the treatment benefits are to help lower blood pressure.  blood pressure is being monitored by the physician and the patient.  so far, the benicar has shown to be as beneficial as the previous medicine patient has been on for the last seven years.  since the pill is considerably larger than previous medicine i was on, i do have to chew the pill. i have not noticed any side effects so far.  i have been taking the medicine about one month.  i plan to visit the doctor in eight weeks again at which time i am sure the doctor will check my blood for any changes that may have occurred.  but so far, nothing has been noticed. i have been on blood pressure medication for about seven years now.  each doctor that i went to has changed my medication several times.  my blood pressure has been lower since visiting a nephrologist.  recently i went to a regular general practitioner and she changed my medicine once again to the benicar.  it seems to be helping somewhat with very few, if any, sign effects."
1,"treatment benefits include improved attention to task, improvement in work quality and quantity. impulsivity was greatly reduced, resulting in a calmer more productive day. social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. social relationships with extended family members were also improved. as a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home. there wer few side effects.  i experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking, speaking at meetings and in social situations.  this can be resolved with small candies, however, that resulted in tooth decay.  i am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist, however, i am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth. i am not sure what you want in this section.  i received counseling.  medication was suggested.  other more typical, stimulant  medications were tried but produced anxiety.  this is a newer non-stimulant medication, and that is a plus. i have continued counseling and periodic check-ups with the prescribing physician.  i am pleased with the results and plan on continuing with this treatment."
1,"lexapro has proven to be a very effective antidepressant that is entirely lacking in sexual side-effects. lexapro is quite stimulating, which i consider to be a good thing, but i do consider the feeling of being a little too euphoric a side effect of the drug. i have suffered from dysthymia (low mood) with major depressive episodes for most of my adult life.  the newer antidepressants, particularly prozac and effexor, were lifesavers for me and i expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  antidepressants such as prozac and lexapro, however, greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).  these medications also ""pooped out"" (stopped working) after a while, and even when they were working, they would not entirely relieve my low mood.  ever since my psychiatrist prescribed lexapro several years ago, my mood issues have entirely disappeared with absolutely no adverse sexual side effects."

0,"i had been having a pro-longed sleep deprivation problem, and was very fatigued and emotionally drained from it. i tried tylenol pm but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking tylenol frequently so i discontinued use. i finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest, and after a consultation, i was prescribed ambien. after trying it, i discovered that i would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares. i would wake up  to  hours later every night though, and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. after a month of that, i gave it up. i ended up taking htp for awhile with melatonin and now i sleep much better. nightmares, short sleep time i was to take  nightly for  month to see if this helped my problem, then return to doctor for consultation."
1,"once daily dose was more convenient than split doses of previous medication. the gradual release of the medication certainly reduced stomach and bowel problems (frequency and urgency of bowel movements) that had hampered activities beneficial to health such as hiking. the medication produced moderate control of my diabetes, though it is hard to judge what my blood sugar would have been without it there is still some degree of bowel disturbance. however, the most concerning side effect (which is common to other (non time release) forms of metformin is impaired b and iron absorption. it took some time to identify this problem and i discovered it myself rather than being tested for it. metformin was the treatment of choice for my diabetes as it does not produce weight gain. i take  time-release tablets after my evening meal. it is important to take the tablets with food to minimise digestive upsets.
on disconcerting feature is that the empty tablet cases pass through the body adn appear in the stools"
1,"the benefits included mood elevation,obsessive thinking became less.  anxiety and sleeping definately improved. major weight gain!!!! i had to take mg. to start and increase from there up to  mg. per day.  i also had some therapy.  homework.  i had to slowly put myself into situations that previously made me very anxious, this drug truly helped!!!  i really did hate the weight gain though."
0,"my father was put on this drug to fend off temporary, situational anxiety when his wife developed alzheimer's and was not looking after the finances properly.  it helped him to sleep better.  in the meantime, our family helped them sort out the financial mess his wife had created in her confusion.  

his anxiety ended but the doctor forgot to take him off the drug at the end of the  month period of effectiveness. after  years of taking this drug, my father has developed short term memory loss which has developed to the point he now has an alzheimer's diagnosis for himself.  he has no other symptoms of ad, just short term memory loss after  years on a drug that is only proven 'effective' for  months. due to a recent mix up at the pharmacy, my father was accidentally withdrawn from the drug and suffered a terrible withdrawal.  after  days without oxazepam, his memory improved but the doctor put him right back on it.  i have since tried to get the doc to take him off.  his answer?  what's the point at his age.  why not just let him drift away in a foggy twilight.  

i love my dad and think he deserves better so i'm fighting this situation, but meanwhile my father wakes up each day wondering why he is on an advanced alzheimer's ward when he has no symptoms beyond drug induced short term memory loss."

1,"i was initially placed on this medication several years ago for ra when vioxx was pulled.  i religiously self administered the medication for two years and then decided to quit because i didn't believe that it was helping much.  i took a ""holiday"" for  months and then checked in with my rheumatologist.  she suggested that i restart the medicine based upon x-rays and blood work.  i have been on it again for mos...i feel better...less pain..more energy. i have not experienced any side effects. i am fortunate that i have good insurance coverage because it is very expensive. as with any medicine...i am concerned about possible long term side effects.  however...my grandmother had ra and was severely crippled with the disease.  this medication is supposed to prevent joint destruction...i am hoping that it will."

1,"the drug cleared the acne.  in addition, it peeled away old skin at the site.  i used it over small wrinkles and skin lines (without doctor's knowledge).  i was pleased with the results over small skin lines.  these dissapeared or diminished.  the product does not work over face parenthesis or deep wrinkles.  it appeared to me that skin's tone also improved.  the skin also developed a healthy shine. the side effects as reported are skin redness and sun sensitivity.  i experienced both.  always use this product with a sun screen or you will burn x faster. the product should be used as directed and a little goes a long ways.  i used too much at the beggining (i also left on the product during the day) and my skin got really irritated and peeled. the product was to be used at bedtime.  to leave on all night and wash in the morning.  the treatment was to continue until acne resolved then use as needed."
0,"initially the treatment benefits were
-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain) the level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication( mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. however the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when i tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication i experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few. i was in an mva in  in which i suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the ddd. i was prescribed percocette mg on an as needed basis for pain control. after  years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and i was referred to a pain clinic specializing in chronic pain. the doctors there decided that i had built up a tolerance/dependence on the percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (oxycontin mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for  hrs) with percocette (oxycodone mg/acetaminophen  mg)for break through pain. in the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time i built up a tolerance to the oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant i had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. for example i started out with oxycontin mg/x day and approx  percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased i had to take oxycontin mg/x day and - percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. after about  months on the oxycontin i started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did i notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past  yrs had dramatically changed. a couple of months ago my sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which i replied nothing why? she then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. being under the influence of these drugs for so long i felt like i was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how i looked. so i stepped back and examined the last - yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. i strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the oxycontin. if i would have known then what i know now about all the negative side effects i would never, never had started taking it. i feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). when i started taking the medication i was  and felt  and was told i looked like i was in my late 's, i am now , i feel  and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old i look . i wish that my physicians would have told me about all of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). in my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. i'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs. please use with caution!"
1,"while i take this drug, i feel very well, happy, i can concentrate in my activities. it helps me to make decisions, i can complete activities, i talk a lot, i stay in a good mood, but just while is during the effects. my heart beats faster and i feel its not in a constant rhythm. my mouth is dry and i feel extremely anxious, and because of this, very clumsy. my diagnostic of add was not really accurate. a did just some practical test but no brain exam. the doctor prescribe ritalin as a test, but because of the side effects i had to stop. i did psychotherapy during the treatment. the ritalin helped me but,of course, didn't stop my problems. i feel really better now, but i didn't find yet a drug to help instead of ritalin."

1,"before i began taking the mirapex, i was taking clonapin which was very ineffective as i was constantly waking up in the middle of the night having to take more medication to get back to sleep. i had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and i was exhausted all the time. on mirapex,  i am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband. i have what i call a window of opportunity to take mirapex by pm or i will be very ""anxious"" and highly uncomfortable due to the restless legs jumping and distress. it causes me to go to sleep shortly after taking it, which makes going to a movie theater almost impossible in the evening as i will sleep through most of the movie if i've taken my medicine. i take mirapex at pm every night so that i will not feel the effects of the restless legs syndrome and will fall asleep, sleeping through the night in my bed without having to get up and walk around. this is a big relief to me and enables me to sleep in the same bed as my husband whereas before, i had to get up out of bed and walk briskly around the house. now i am rested and able to function the next day. i have been part of a study group for restless legs syndrome and i was the only one whose doctor had put them on mirapex... others were on requip and experiencing significant amounts of stress. after hearing about my experience with mirapex, they were going to ask their doctors about it."
0,"i believe that the premearin allowed normal vaginal secretions and
somewhat emotional stability.  during the time i was using the premarin i had
decreased hot flashes/sweats that, i presumed was a result of the drug, although the hot flashes are much more infrequent now that i'm using the natural progesterone cream. while using the premarin pills for hormonal replacement therapy i was also taking progestin so am unsure as to which drug was causing my very painfully tender breasts with increased fibrocystic breast disease noted on my annual momograms. i suspect that these drugs were also contributing to the blood sugar issues and low throid. i chose to discontinue the hrt completely after i developed a painful mastitis in my lt breast, and months later a mamogram showed a suspicious spot that was removed and biopsied. it was benign. since stopping the premarin and switching to a natural progesterone cream that i use vaginally i no longer have painful fibrocystic breasts and the hypoglycemia and hypothyroid have been healed thru prayer."

0,"the premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  from that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  however, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  it took me two years to discern that the problems i encountered were attributable directly to the premarin. i developed strange lesions on my arms, which were sore and very embarrassing.  i could not wear short-sleeved shirts, because of the mess my arms had become.  obviously, i showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.  when i went off the premarin, on my own volition, the lesions disappeared to a significant degree.  when i added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet, the lesions disappeared completely.  i am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever. the doctor put me on the maximum dosage because i was ""young"" for menopause.  did not test estrogen levels either before beginning treatment or after starting the hrt.  i simply took one premarin pill per day, every day."
1,"i was given valium to calm me down as i couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  i found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  it helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  i think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed i find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things i wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  i get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. i feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  however it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then i just feel relaxed. i didn't have any side effects at all.  but it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (yes, i can actually feel when it starts) i started having panic attacks in different places until my world became very restricted.  a doctor prescribed valium and it helped.  i have still got worse over the years but valium still helps me cope with things like that i wouldn't normally be able to do at all, like shopping, going to the dentist, or out in public.  i feel valium has had a very bad write up...mainly i feel through abuse.  i've taken it most of my life and never took more than i was told to.  in fact i was so afraid it would ""stop"" working that i only took it when absolutely necessary.  this means that although i have taken it most of my life in larger or smaller doses, it still works for me and gets me though the hard times.  i don't think i have ever tried a drug that has helped me cope as well as this one has.  i hope it never gets taken off the market.  i currently take half a  mg tab when i have to do something i consider difficult, only taking the other half after assessing if one half is enough.  i hardly ever take more than one in a day and hardly ever more than two tabs in a week....sometimes a month.  depending on my commitments."

1,the once daily treatment was effective in keeping me from having moderate acne breakouts while i was taking hormone replacement therapy.  i also used testosterone cream (compounded) and my doctor felt that this was the source of the acne and also some water retention. i don't believe i experienced any side effects at all and have always been very satisfied with the the medication.  i have only recently begun to look at other kinds of hormone replacement therapy that is all compounded and natural based. i have taken  mg tablet daily for over  years for treatment of acne...caused by hormone replacement medications including testosterone cream.  the medication worked very well for me for as long as i was taking it.

i could not sleep no matter how tired i became during the day. i had constant energy that would not go away even when i wanted to sleep. the insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract paxil.
dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.

1,"the medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  i was getting a headache almost dailey. it was affecting my job and family life. my migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. taking relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it. the side effects were mild compared to the pain. around  minutes after taking the pill, i would feel a little tired and sleepy.  however the feeling would not be so severe that i could not work or continue daily tasks.  this side effect would pass in about - hours. at the onset of the headache, i would take a pill.  some of my headaches would start at night, around :am and i would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  wrong decision.  i quickly learned to take the pill as soon as i felt any sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  if you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  that could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.  it is extremely important to take this pill at the onset of a headache."

1,"completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face, neck, shoulders, back, and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time. dry, chapped lips and dry, flaky skin especially after showers. both were completely treatable with chapstick and good lotion. no serious side effects, and no alarming changes in liver function or triglycerides on blood tests. no depression as well. i had slight to moderate acne that was just really annoying and was not fixed by any type of treatment, so i finally gave in and went on accutane. after reading all the online horror stories i was scared out of my mind. however, i had a great experience on it. i took mg/day for  months and weigh  lbs ( kgs) so it was about  mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose i was told. my lips were pretty dry and cracked if i didn't put on chapstick all the time. i also had really dry skin if i didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. everything else was % fine though. no nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. these horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. my acne is gone % from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. on completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for  years and has never once had a case of depression and only  people have had bad blood tests. if you're tired of acne, give accutane a shot. if the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me."

1,"started taking this drug for two reasons - peri-menopausal symptoms (mood swings) and depression experienced after going through hurricane katrina. after - weeks of starting, noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated. fortunately, none for me. i know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain, but i have had no issues here. the only thing i noticed was the very first week i took it i was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day, but this went away once i adjusted. started out with a very low dose, mg/day for the first month, then moved up to  mg/day which is my present dose. the full dose is actually mg/day, but i feel i am getting the results i need with mg, so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects."
1,"i was prescribed the drug mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  the doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently mg ( pills) every evening.  there was a significant reduction in crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  this was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as i was relaxing to go to sleep. though the crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and i feel that the addition of the mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  the fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  i also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  by suppressing my immune system i believe the mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop. i was diagnosed with crohn's disease about eight years ago.  the doctor started with a series of remicade and a prescription of prednisone. this combination made it possible for me to eat again - hurray!  as for maintenance drugs, i have been on several, including asacol and pentasa.  there were probably others, but those are the two that i definitely remember.  it seemed as though my body would react well to a drug, but then the drug eventually lost that initial effectiveness. i have been on mercaptopurine for - years now, and am getting ready to ask to move to a new drug. mercaptopurine seems to be continuing to do a good job as a drug, but i'd like to find one that may be less deleterious to my liver."

1,"after starting on a diuretic and a beta blocker without significant results, adding the ace inhibitor worked wonders, and has continued to do so for  years. the next step, if one becomes necessary will be to add a sartan. based on my previous response. i expect it to be a happy experience. for no apparent reason the dosage needs to be adjusted, up or down from time to time. fortunately hypertension is not asymptomatic in this patient: have a headache, it's up, raise the dose; feel wiped out, it's down, lower the dose. all this has been confirmed by home, office, and pharmacy readings. i never expected to live this long, let alone feel as healthy as i do. my mother died at age , and the last years of her life were marred by pain, discomfort and significant disability due to cardiovascular disease.

1,"this drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  the depression was less affected, but definately improved.  i felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  i wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time. at first the dose of mg left me a little zombie like.  i'd sit and stare out the window all day.  when the dose was reduced to mg. this side effect went away.  i also developed a clenched jaw, which sometimes i snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  i also developed ringing in my ears.  i also gained weight, a total of  pounds. i was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug, beginning with mg and then reducing it to mg.  i was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  this drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together i believe they were very effective.  i was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  the side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain."
1,it did clear up my inner ear water. it also seemed to dry up the constant mucus that seemed to be in my sinuses. this helped me to be able to breathe better. the only side effect that i could notice was dryness in my mouth and nostrils. i seemed to be thirsty all of the time. and my nose and sinuses seemed to be really dry. i took  pill each day. i enjoyed not having to take it more than once per day. i have problems remembering to take more than one dose a day.

1,"my attention span was incrementally increased, as was the intensity of my focus. also, while taking the drug, i noted a significant decrease in my appetite, which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss. i experienced heightened levels of sleeplessness while on the medication. in addition, i was constantly concerned about my ability to study and perform while not on the medication. while this is not a physical side effect, it is a very real emotional one that caused me some stress. after noticing that i was having difficulty being attentive during my high school classes, experiencing an inability to sustain focus on one thing at a time, and was unable to finish assignments on time due to these two symptoms, i decided to see my doctor. he asked me a variety of questions about my current state and the problems i was having, and after listening, prescribed a small dosage of adderall to alleviate these issues. after taking the first dose, my concentration increased ten-fold. as a result, my grades went up. i discontinued my use of adderall upon my college graduation, and have found that while i still suffer from symptoms of attention deficit disorder, it is having a decreased effect on my adult life."

0,"considerably reduced pain, if i experienced any at all. with two tablets, the main difference was moderate to severe drowsiness. with either dosage, i experienced vibrant dreams/nightmares and/or an elated/lightheaded feeling while awake. constipation relieved with extra fiber. in my experience with this medication, i've found it moderately addicting and should be taken with caution. i advise to take when in mild-moderate pain because that's what it's for, but hold off taking it every six hours (or as prescribed) if pain is not an issue."
1,"since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure, the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. however, i've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections. sleeplessness, easily bruised, diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so after i ceased taking amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. i've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. it's my understanding that this high-dosage, antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended. to the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard'  -   mg. tablets to be taken  hour before any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly after the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. i followed that procedure."
1,"retin a micro has lessened any uneven skin pigmentation.  retin a micro has minimized the size of my pores.  retin a micro has minimized wrinkling in my skin. retin a micro causes me to peel the second day after i use retin a micro in the evening.  retin a micro initially causes more noticible fine lines when used around the eyes but i am continuing to use around the eyes for  months to see if ultimately it improves this area. i initially began using retin a micro all over my face and neck (avoiding eye area) every other night.  my skin is fair and a little sensitive and it has tolerated it very well.  every other day i do get a slight peeling of my skin around my mouth, my chin and my nose.  this peeling can easily be removed by sloughing off the peeling skin.  the benefits of retin a micro are unlike any skin product you could buy over the counter, used in conjunction with an effective sunscreen."
1,"prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. prozac was effective for the first  years then my depression slowly started to become worse. i then had to be placed on wellbutrin for about  years, along with prozac and yet my side effects from prozac increassed to the point where i was taken off prozac. the main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. over time the shaking turned into tremors which i could not control. then i was placed on wellbutrin with prozac and finally weined off of prozac and the tremors subsided. i took prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. at first my depression was under control but after about  years the depression began to become more intense. i was then placed on wellbutrin with prozac and my depression soon was improving. however, i started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. so after  years of prozac and wellbutrin i was told to stop prozac. within  months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only wellbutrin ( mg/day)"

1,if taken within the first hour of of your personal migraine symtoms the med. works very well. usually within an hour you can control the nausea and light sensitivity with only a little sleepiness.it only takes about  to  minutes to take effect so if you catch it early you can forego almost all your pain. the main side effects for me are sleepiness and moodiness. the sleepiness can be good if you have time to rest for a couple of hours..if not... it can be a little difficult to navigate through the day. the moodiness for me may simply be my depression over having another migraine...i am always hoping my last migraine was my last. take one tablet on the onset of headache..usually if i take it within the first  min. i can control the nausea that accompanies the migraine...if i wait too long the med. doesn't work very well. also the ins. company limits me to  pills a month so if have to be very dilligent about taking the med. right away or i will have to take a second one a few hours later....they are too precious to use that much

1,"overall cholesterol dropped from  to . hdl went up, ldl went down to optimal ratios. my cholesterol numbers changed very quickly, within little over a month. obviously, it's a very effective drug for me. no detectable side effects. i hope that there are no long-term liver problems due to this drug, and at this time, there are no indications of any problems in this area. one  mg pill, x per day. 

i also received a blood test for liver abnormality at one month, three months, and one year, after beginning treatment. i now receive a blood test for liver abnormalities every  / to  years, along with the rest of my regular bloodwork at normal checkups. so far, there have been no indications of any problems.

i'm also taking  mg per day of co q to replace what the liptor diminishes. i do wish that my physician had mentioned this to me when he prescribed the lipitor, but i actually found out about co q and lipitor through reading dr oz and rizen's book ""you, staying young"". upon asking my doctor about the co q, he was familiar with it in relation to lipitor usage, but never brought it up on his own. i realize that i would have continued taking lipitor without any co q addition if i hadn't stumbled upon those facts by accident myself, and wish that when a physician prescribes a medication that they would also suggest any other supplements that should be taken or avoided along with the prescription.

overall, this drug has been very successful for me. as i understand it, most people have to take a much higher dose than i do to obtain similar benefits, so i'm fortunate in this area, as i don't like to take much medication."
1,"the only treatmenet benefits were the prevention of pregnancy and the near elimination of a monthly menstrual cycle --including the elimination of painful cramping during the monthly cyle.  the benefits at the time i was taking this medication outweighed the risks/side effects, but now the risks/side effects outweigh the benefits. the main side effect was moodiness/mood swings.  i did not notice this so much while taking the medication.  i noticed the moodiness/mood swings more after being off of the medication for an extended period of time.  after being off of the medication i noticed a more stabe, hightened mood. the treatment continued off and on for approximately  years.  during this time, i did go off of the medication for short intervals just due to the lack of necessity for the drug.  the medication was taken on a daily basis, and was effective.  now, however, for me--the health risks involved in taking the drug (risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots) far outweigh the benefits (i am a non smoker).  in addition, the mood factor also played a part in not returning to taking this drug."
1,"prevented mania and panic experienced with mania severe acne for first three years. after the initial three years, this drug has worked well for me ever since."
1,"very good pain relief and muscle relaxation.  great for alleviating pain from an especially bad headache but also works good as an adjunct for musculoskeletal pain. sedation, dizziness, very mild euphoria, intoxicated feeling (slurred speech, ataxia) at higher or repeated doses.  addiction risk. good at knocking down a particularly bad headache or other breakthrough pain.  works better when taken at first sign of pain.  butalbital and caffeine can cancel each other's sedating and stimulating effects, but a tolerance to caffeine will negate that.  even so caffeine helps boost the effectiveness of acetaminophen.
tolerance to butalbital's intoxication effects happen quickly but it can still be sedating.  driving and other functions are impaired; if i have to take fioricet it's typically in the evening and then i'm done for the day."
1,"the objective of tamoxifen is to work against the effects of estrogen on cancer cells. as a treatment for breast cancer, the drug is supposed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that are present in the body. i am praying that this is fulfilling its purpose but only in rd month of taking it so who knows. main side effect : vaginal discharge, slight weight gain (water retention i hope)
and heartburn. i have to take tamoxifen for  years."
1,"ability to have benefits of birth control in the convenience of a ring, that allows freedom from worrying about taking a pill and an unwanted pregnancy. my first week with the ring i experienced extreme nausea, upset stomach and a tremendous decrease in appetite.  these symptoms slowly faded as the weeks passed.  now the only side effects i notice are a less than normal appetite and occasional vaginal irritation, but nothing to painful or bothersome that i feel the need to seek medical treatment. i'm married, i have both a full & part time job and i'm enrolled  hrs in school.  the one less stress of not having to worry about birth control let's me focus on what's important right now.  this is my method of choice and will be until i decide i'm ready for children.  nuvaring is reliable... you can't really mess it up.  the fact that i don't have to worry about a little pill everyday makes my quality of life better.  i have the nuvaring timer, which you can order from the website, that aids in reminding me that it's time, whether it be insertion or removal, and can be reset for whatever day you choose for insertion.  i can see how one might forget they even have it in them.  i do not feel it, my husband cannot feel it, and it has not fallen out, like several other women have claimed.  i'm very pleased with this and hope that it works as well for others as it has for me."

1,"wanting to be drug free, i weened myself off of the wellbutrin, but found that i could not happily function without the lexapro.  when i tried to lower (self medicate) the dosage, my racing and repeating thoughts came back really strong.  i started counting again, repeating sentences in my head, singing song verses over and over in my head, replaying conversations over in my head, etc.  being back on the mg keeps me feeling normal and only in very stressful situations do i start obsessing/repeating. i didn't experience any side effects.  i purposely did not read what the potential side effects might be, as i tend to ""develop"" whatever i read about. the initial treatment involved the medication and weekly therapy sessions.  a year into the treatment, i was able to scale the therapy back to ""as needed"" appointments, a year later i went off of the wellbutrin and now feel pretty healthy just on the lexapro."
0,"moderate seizure control, seizures controlled during the awake hours, however, still uncontrolled during sleep.  patient has multiple, short seizures, nightly. side effects were at first loss of appetite, then later, increased appetite.  also some irritability which we cannot be sure but may be related to the drug.  however, it could be due to the nighttime seizures which are still occurring. take  mg of valproic acid before bed, daily, and  mg at breakfast, daily.  this dose was titrated up slowly and eventually stopped at this level. blood work is done to check the blood trough level.  we are instructed to contact the physician should the seizure pattern change."

0,"the treatment benefits are that it has stopped  the acid from coming up into my esphogus.  i also has benefited from further damage to my esphogus from the acid reflux. i do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. the nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid. after about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping, bloating, and diareaha.  my body is now completely depended on the drug and my understanding is that the pill is telling my body not to produce acid which in turn works harder to produce more, which makes since when i have tried to go off of it my acid reflux was  times worse.  my body has become completely dependent on the drug. the treatment details were that i did not need to change my diet, but to just take one pill every day and that would take care of my issue with my body producing to much acid."

1,i did get relief from the hot flashes and this did contribute to a good nights sleep. i had a hystirectomy a year before i was put on the hormones. i say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. i can not say that i have seen a slowing in the aging process but i am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin. i have not experienced any side effects to my knowledge. i feel as if an increase in the dose would maybe last longer as i seem to be waking at least once a night with a hot flash. i take it in the morning so maybe by the time i hit the sheets it is out of my system. i do not miss a day and always take it at the same time each morning. as i stated i had a hystirectomy at  years old. i went over a year w/out any homone treatment and the hot flashes got so severe i was waking about  to  times a night. i was using over the counter sleep aids and did not like them. i got the doctor to prescribe the hormones and the benefits were almost immediate. i have been on the same dose for over a year now and feel i might benefit from an increased dose. i am  now and am looking not quite my age but the aging process is speeding up i feel.
1,"the cream did reduce fine lines but my skin peeled first so i only usie it oc.casionally now. i would use it, the skin would peel and the lines are slightly reduced. it also dries up blemishes peeling, dryness, slight irritation. there weren't any serious side effects.  the packaging warns about sun exposure but i stay away from the sun so i did not have a reaction from the sun while using product. i used this cream a few times a week at first and now i use it only occasionally. it is a moderately thick white cream that i applied only to target areas, frown lines, forehead, etc. also applied to breakouts. the skin would peel slightly after a day or two and then new skin is revealed underneath. this is a very easy way to treat very fine lines."
1,"wellbutrin xl made a real difference in my life.  i had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking wellbutrin, my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  i was not a majorly depressed person, just mildly depressed and fatigued, and also becoming uninterested in activities that i used to enjoy.  wellbutrin definitely made me feel happier and more interested in life. as far as the rumor goes of wellbutrin enhancing sexual desire - i have not noticed a diffence in myself in that regard. i have to take the pill at night.  if i take the pill in the morning, i notice that i get a headache about p. i take mg once a day and i've been on wellbutrin for  years now and my doctor said there is no reason to stop taking it."
1,"meloxicam was prescribed after vioxx was taken off the market.  it has been beneficial in relieving the pain from a pinched nerve.

1,"lifting of mood. no noticeable side-effects from the brand name, problems with generic.  details in next section. i began taking wellbutrin about  years ago.  at some point, i realized the generic was available and switched to it.  i did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as i thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand, minus the ink used to print ""wellbutrin"" on the pills.  it took about a month before i thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of ""heart pounding.""  i switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase, i think, but i didn't actually take my pulse), i had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  this was not a surface capillary, but a deep vessel, that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.  the bursting was not associated with any trauma to the hand, but seemed rather spontaneous."

1,no side effects and the crying went away. it really helped me when nothing else did. none the wellbutrin pulled me out of the black hole and after a load of meds that were affective on serotonin that made me manic or did nothing at all and almost wrecked my life this finally leveled me out....thank god.
1,"this is a miracle drug for me, got rid of vaginal dryness, and even got rid of hot flashes, even though the estrogen dose is so low!  would recommend to anybody. none took it for two weeks every day, and then twice a week for maintenance - this is just enough.  too bad that it does not come in the cream form as well - would be more convenient then the suppository."

1,"clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. it soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. use continued for six months with no results. the rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of mrsa was made. the clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. use was discontinued and bactroban and septra ds was highly effective at clearing the infection. have since had no need for clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. for those who chose to traditional medications, i can recommend clobex for mild to severe dermatitis. i was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of skin mrsa, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes. none had developed contact dermatitis on my arm; cause unknown. dermatologist prescibed clobex .% bid until condition cleared. the solution went on easily, non-greasy and calmed any itching. no bandaging was needed. the dermatitis cleared quickly and no follow-up was necessary."

0,"i felt calmer and my overall outlook was better. it was subtle...still had some nerve problems and anxiety, but my guess is thats because it does not erase problems...but you can tolerate them better over the long haul. none that i noticed. i had alot of grief and was nervous at work, so my md gave me this medicine to help with those problems.  it did help a bit with the physical nerve problem...less jittery and all that...but it didnt stop it completely.  i was able to function and not feel light headed or fuzzy...which i did not want. so that was a plus...i stayed on it for aprox  year...then lost my healthcare insurance so i no longer take it."

1,"storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  but the main benefit is that the lesions that i was originally diagnosed with did not worsen over time.  in addition,  i have had no new lesions since beginning betaseron.  so this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and i believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  which, if you have ms this is what you aim for. i do, for some unknown reason, still have side effects from the betaseron.  they don't happen every injection, and there is no pattern.  i will have a fever and/or chills, and i hurt all over.  it feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   and my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles, but they are not infections, just a side effect.  and for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst. i guess the treatment details are how i take it.  the injections are deep subcutaneous.  because the drug is very hard on tissue, you can't inject into the same area.  upper arms are divided into  imaginary sections, abdomen  areas, legs  areas, and buttocks .  so inject into first arm area on one arm, then next injection opposite arm, then abdomen, legs, and buttocks.  then you must start over in the first arm, but a different section and then work your way down again.  this keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.  the injections are every other night, and come in a pre-measured syringe the must be mixed slowly with the powder immediately before injection.  make sure to not agitate the sol'n, as it will foam, then you can't get it in the syringe, and then it's useless."

0,"none. when i was last encountering depression  years ago, my doctor gave me some round green pills whose name i can't rememeber. they worked well, helping numb my depression as i sorted out my life. after recent suicidal feelings regarding a reactive depression to losing my job, my gp prescribed me citalopram. i just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy. i took one late at night hoping to feel sleepy at least, but had one of the worst nights sleep of my life. i encountered sweating,shakes, jaw grinding, and horrible hallucinatory dreams whilst still awake.  my gp told me i had to take them for at least a fortnight to feel any effect so tried again the following night, but the side effects were even worse. the way my jaw and teeth would involuntairily chatter was scary as hell. if i did this every sleepless night for  weeks, i'd have ended up insane, so i stopped after after just  nights i never went back to the doctor. i was so desperate for a good nights sleep without teeth-grinding and nightmares, i fell back on alcohol. i've never taken valium, but feel i should've been given something similar - somthing that would heavily sedate me while i was feeling suicidal. luckily after a week, my fortunes changed, and i found work again, so the suicidal feelings went.  but i would never take citalopram again."

1,"generally, lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). the mood difference is noticeable. my pscychiatrist prescribed lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. considering that i had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice. i have noticed no side effects. i take  mg of lamictal orally, twice a day. generally, i take the first pill when i wake up in the morning, and i take the second pill with dinner."
0,"none, i was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. i had no energy. it just didn't work and that was the side affects. i was put on synthroid to cure a slow thyroid. it did not help and i discontinued use. i was changed to armour thyroid and have had fabulous results with it. armour throid is what was giving to before the drug companies came out with a synthetic version of it."

1,"happier, slept better. the lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the trazadone with sleep. together they worked quite well, i thought, as i was peppier during the day and slept well at night. so all in all, i would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. i felt cured groggy sometimes. and i could not really stop, though i was able to play with the amount of the trazodone, lowering it down to  mg. whenever ever i could. i did not notice side effects from lexapro, just perhaps that i became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. so at a certain point, i wanted to get off. i had wonderful dreams on trazodone, but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for - extra hours. - mg of trazodone and  mg of lexapro daily. i took all at night, just before going to bed. i would when trying to bring the trazodone down--so i would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly,  mg less every few days. usually this would work. if i woke in the middle of the night, i would immediately get up and take another  mg. i have probably taken up to  mg in one night, but very rarely. and i have had long periods where i was at  mg, only taking more if i was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. i recommend this combination really."
1,"stratterra enabled me to concentrate and focus on tasks at hand.  it makes a world of difference in my daily life.  after four years of using stratterra, i would never switch to a different adhd medication. stratterra surpresses my appetite and makes me feel quite dependent on the drug to function. if i take with my multivitamin, i often feel nauseous. i take   mg of stratterra in the morning daily."
0,"the leg clot would not extend nor would other clots form, potentially causing death. these were severe and included extreme and continuous nausea, feeling generally shitty (technical term employed by patient), no libido and inability to maintain erection during sex, orgasms that petered out and gave little pleasure, no overall energy for life.
patient decided to stop medication and try natural/alternative substance to thin the blood.  this resulted in an extension of the clot and increased severity of pain, leading to emergency room visit and subsequent use of different blood thinner, syntron. treatment included months of heparin injections in abdomen.  coumadin was given daily after the injections were stopped, at mg. the discontinuation of this medication caused an extension of the clot and re-admittance to hospital and another drug for blood thinning was given.   eventually,  months later, a doctor prescribed a compression stocking, which helped dramatically with swelling and pain.  the syntron blood thinner had no noticeable side-effects.  except possibly a still reduced libido."

1,"having suffered with depression/anxiety after the break up of my marriage, during which i lost a huge amount of weight, couldn't sleep, was agitated, tearful etc etc. the fluoxetine initially helped me relax and gave me a 'holiday from myself'.  the effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  i regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine, have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  my experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings. no side effects as such.  however, the negative from my point of view is that there is an almost unreal calmness and lack of feeling/excitement/or even anger.........however as it is my intention to only use the fluoxetine for what is a relatively short term period, i beleive that this has been a 'symptom' worth experiencing.  mg once a day."
1,"lost  pounds and did not feel hungry while taking the medicine. on days that i forgot to take a capsule, i did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet. there were no side effects that i could trace directly to meridia. mild constipation is a possible side effect, but that could also have been due to dehydration. i took one meridia first thing in the morning and then stuck to a sensible diet for the day.  if i took the meridia too late in the day, it did keep me from sleeping well that night."

it was getting harder to breath.  i called my dr. and was told to quit taking the cipro and an alternative

0,"i never got pimples, pustules, or anything else associated with this condition.  but maybe i never would have--it is hard to say.

the first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  i really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  also, i oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  so one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics. hard to say.  

during the fifteen years i took it, my pores enlarged and became clogged.  that may have been due to age and other factors--but i could not help but suspect that some of the heavy waxes and oils used in the product may have contributed.

metrogel left an ashy white residue, so i switched to the cream.  maybe the gel would have less clogging effect.  

later, i got prescription insurance coverage and had to take a generic, which may have had even cheaper inactive ingredients. i never had a problem with rosacea.  i went to a dermatologist and was kept waiting two hours.  i was embarrassed because i kept literally falling asleep in the waiting room.  i asked the receptionist if i had time to run out and get a cup of coffee.  after i drank the coffee, my cheeks flushed bright red--that was the only symptom of rosacea.

after fifteen years and several changes of dermatologists, i got a new doctor and asked if the metronidazole could be causing enlarged pores.  when she found out that i never had pimples or pustules, she suggested i try not using the metronidazole at all.  i have not used it for the last six weeks and i see no change.  i prefer using a lighter moisturizer."

1,"the wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  with just the two antidepressants i could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  but the lamictal prevented me from going down.  i have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and i have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  the doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis i had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really i was a manic-depressive (which i am not).  apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  this is what i thought was implied.  boy have i been glad that someone came up with lamical. there were no side effects.  if there were,(which i don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. some people say they are the type that has all the side effects. i seem to be the one that has none of the side effects. the treatment has been mg/day for three years."

now i'm back on the mg of aricept for the past  weeks and the plan is to stay on that dose for  months to a year. the side effects were the same at first, and are now getting better each day. i suspect those side effects to subside in the next few weeks. and cognitively - i am improving again each day."

0,"in only took the pill for a month, so i do not think it was enough time to see the benefits. almost within the first week of taking the medication i noticed a decreased in libido (sexual drive), night time erections were gone, and morning wood was no longer there. i read about the drug before using it and i was very hesitant about using it since i heard about all the negative side effects. it didn't seem worth it to take the risk and try it, but i spoke to me doctor about it. he advised me that if i noticed any of the symptoms, i should stop taking the medicine immediately. i took the chance because i don't want to look back ten (more like two, to be honest)years from now and say, ""man, i really wish i would have tried it. maybe it would have worked, i should have at least done my best to fight this monster called baldness."" so i tried it, and i knew almost within the second week that it wasn't for me. i notice all of the side effects and stop taking the medicine. i'm thankful for this website because it gives people the opportunity to be honest and share there experiences. if i had not read some of the comments, i might have continued with the medication and done more damage without knowing it. so thank you. i tried the drug, and realized it wasn't for me. i am very lucky that all of the symptoms have passed and i am back to normal. funny thing though, here is something i realized, "" i can't get laid without my hair, but if i take this drug, i can have hair but i still can't get laid."" who says the bug guy up there doesn't have a sense of humor? good luck everyone."

0,"in the beginning my seizures seemed to decrease, however at the time i was also on depakote and diamox as well as valium for right temporal lobe epilepsy; my doctor added keppra before he started weaning me off the depakote and diamox. i was feeling a lot better on all those meds. then just the keppra. side effects= intermittent headaches,weakness,shaky and double vision, poor muscle coordination, problem with movement, walking, abnormal gait, behavioral changes, anger,weight loss, slurred speech, & memory loss. i started on keppra in feb.

1,"increased energy and memory.  levothyroxine treatment alone was not working well.  the combination works much better. none since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my doctor�s would treat with basically the levothyroxine.  the levels would be increased until i was �in the range�, but i never felt quite right.  i was still very tired and my memory, especially short-term, was really bad.  i went to a couple endocrinologists, with the first one diagnosing the hypothyroidism as a result of hashimoto�s disease.  even with this diagnosis, the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and i continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  i decided to go for a second opinion, and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of levothyroxine and cytomel.  this seemed to turn me around.  the memory and tiredness have gotten better, still not optimal.  it seems as long as one is �in the range�, doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.  i would like to see physicians listen to their patients and adjust the meds until they feel better, not just go �by the range�."
1,"stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again. none -- no weight loss unfortunately started with  mg once daily. this worked for several years. when spouse endured  years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to  mg taken as  mg pills."

1,"i have debilitating panic attacks. after i was on zoloft for a couple of weeks i noticed a substantial difference. i no longer felt the ""looming dread"" that comes with a panic attack and i just felt calmer and more in control than before. i was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease. i went off of zoloft on my own in october of . i went down gradually from mg to  for about a week and then went off completely. the two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. the panic attacks didn't come back but i'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). i also had the strangest, most vivid dreams. i recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea i'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky. my family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. i saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if i have a panic attack. which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of anything constructive with your time."
1,"it was calming within a very short time.  at the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. it began to work very quickly after taking it. it made me a little bit too sleepy.  it also was relaxing to the point that i felt a little disoriented.  it was a great solution as long as i was at home.  it would not have been practical to take when working, driving, etc. it was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.  i would take the tablet at the onset of the attack.  the attacks usually occured at night, shortly after i feel asleep."

1,"within - weeks i had no depression and less hyperactivity; i was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. i told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-adhd) adults feel like. a small amount of shaking, mainly felt when drinking from a cup. it's not supposed to affect weight and hunger, but i have gained some weight, though i don't know if or how the medicine contributed. before using wellbutrin i had trouble getting to sleep, then trouble getting up in the morning. i was very irritable, depressed and frustrated. i always felt groggy and could not 'get it together' until late in the day. when my treatment began, i started by taking one  mg pill first thing in the morning for a week. then i took one  mg pill in am and one  mg pill in pm (this was before xl came out). the third week and from then on i took  mg in morning. i felt so much better that i was not bothered by the slight let down in the evening. however,i didn't feel really well consistently all day until the xl formula came out. i have tried the generic and i don't feel as well and i had constant stomach aches to the point that i was having pain near my gall bladder and was considering being evaluated for gallstones. all of this cleared up when i went back to wellbutrin xl and i have not had a problem since."

1,"i was actually throwing up a couple of times a week during the night. found i had barretts and the treatment cleared up the barretts after about  years. i have an artifical hip and have constant discomfort where implant was put into femur. i was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about  days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. sometimes when i overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol i get extreme chest pain. i actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. after it subsides which is usually  to  minutes i will be extremely exhaused.the first time it happened i thought i was actually having a heart attack.so to counter the issue i try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day. i still don't know i the moderate discomfort in my leg is the medication, so i guess i will live with it.i have read a bit about the different symptoms and being a little older its hard to determine if its drugs or age causing some of the issues. i take mg everyday before i eat dinner. to me the side effects have been worth it i don't believe i would be here today if i wasn't taking this medication. my dad died of stomach cancer. my brother and sister exhibit the gerd symptoms and are also on the drug now."
1,medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. had to continually change dosage. the medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. i was anticipating having children within a few years. i went in and had the radio active iodine. after one month my thyroid was destroyed. had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. my doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least  years. when taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. multivitamins with iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least  hours after taking sythroid. never miss a dosage. i once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked. the radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. i was given a pill to swallow. i was then asked to come back after  hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. i came back the next day for another scan. after one week i had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. i have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. in some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels i have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.

1,the first time i took it the cold sore ended up just slightly smaller than they usually are. the second time it was about / the size. the third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. the forth time i didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. i used to get them about every  to  weeks but the last one came about  months after the previous one. no side effects at all. you take  pills as soon as you can tell the cold sore is beginning and then  pills  hours later.
1,i saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. i was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. i had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  my skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time. the first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and i had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away. i would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry i would apply a small amount of retin-a to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. the evenings that i did not use retin-a i would use a good night moisturizer.
1,"the ibuprofen gel would enable instant relief as it could be applied topically and carried around easily in ones pocket/bag.
the diclomax sr tablets tended to work quite quickly therefore providing quick relief. i also used an ice pack which combined with the other treatments mentioned gave me round the clock relief. i experienced stomach pains and bleeding when tablets were taken on an empty stomach.  this was the only side effect i experienced and as long as you can be organised about when you eat and take the tablets then it causes no problems at all.  given the fact i relied on these tablets for  years, the side effects were extremely mild and forgettable. the treatment was for my back pain, this was lower back pain caused by a slipped disk.  i also received cortisone injections which gave little or no relief.  i was prescribed  tablets a day of mg dosage to take with meals.
i also had to undertake some back strength exercises in order to strengthen the muscles which had wasted away."
0,"it effectively stopped migraine at the ""aura"" stage.  no need to take any additional medications. massive dizziness/ ""drugged"" feeling.  a feeling of being ""out of it"" --- unable to focus eyes, exhausted, etc.  impossible to function until the effect wore off.  not convinced this is the best option for migraine treatment.  although it was effective, the side effects were almost not worth it.  there have got to be better options out there. every time more than one pill was taken (where one was ineffective in stopping the progression of a migraine), massive dizziness and drugged feeling would result."
1,with the treatment i feel less tired and more energetic.i comeback to my normal weight and i stop losing my hair. also i do not get cold as i use to. i did not have any side effects after the doctor find the right dosage i was able to function like i used to before i have the symptoms of the hypothyroid. i take one tablet everyday in the morning in a empty stomach around the same time and i wait an hour before i eat. sometimes i can only wait  minutes and it does not seems to alter the effect of the medication.
1,"opened airways to help breath none. i did have concerns about taking an oral steroid,but was reassured that the short duration would not cause adverse side effects. after a first round of antibiotics and use of arbuterol with a nebulizer with minimal effectiveness, my doctor put me on an oral steroid to open up my airways. once i started the seroid, i felt % better."
1,"anti-inflammatory effect on my joints helped a lot especially my spine.

0,"the adderall allows me to focus and study better.  i definitely function better while taking it.  i am prescribed to take it ""as needed"" which means that i don't take it everyday.  i tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  i am prescribed to take it up to  times a day, but i rarely have taken that much. if i take a  mg pill later than  pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  i sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  sometimes i have strange muscle twitches that i can't control.  some days it makes me lose my appetite completely, which doesn't sound bad but i'm already a little underweight. since i control when i take the meds (what time, how much- up to  per day) i think i have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what i'm perscribed.  some days i will take  pills so i can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  so, even though i'm doing what i'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  i can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.  even with all that, the drug has helped me out more than i can ever explain."
1,"severe long term depression and anxiety were alleviated. yawning, tiredness, lethargy, dry eyes/sinuses. over time the drug seemed to build up in my system (the dr. determined that i metabolize this particular drug slowly)and my dosage had to be adjusted to mg/day. mg/day takes the edge off the depression but does not cause the extreme exhaustion experienced at higher doses.

this medication is excellent despite some mild side effects. it does not cause any of the musculo/skelatal pain or sleep interuptions i experienced with other anti-depressants. treatment began  years ago, mg/day was adusted to mg/day taken at bedtime for  and a half years.  months ago dosage was decreeased to mg/day at bedtime."

0,"it did help to control bladder infections. i was  at the time and experienced chronic yeast infections while this drug. about  years later i had severe bladder pain, but no infection was present. after bladder biopsy it was determined that i had intercystial cystitis and the doctor feels it was from being on this antibiotic long term. i suffered with this condition for  years and finally had dmso bladder washes which relieved the problem greatly. to this day i have bladder pain occasionally. after suffering numerous bladder infections, it was determined that i needed longterm antibiotic treatment to get the problem under control. six months of keflex. because this was  years ago i am not sure of the dosage."
1,"the benefits of seasonale is that you only have your period once every three months. in my situation, i continually have spot bleeding towards the end of every  day cycle which should not occur.  my doctor advised that this would lessen the longer i stay on this medication however, it only improved slighty and i never can make it through the entire  days, my period always starts a few days before i've finished the last few pills. you take one pill every day for  days, wait  days, and then begin the cycle again."
1,"prevented infection of surgically sewn gums.  they cut my gums and pulled them down further over the teeth and added a laboratory grown skin product to make the gum larger.  i also used this periogard bottle when they put caps on my teeth, just to prevent infection. i had no side effects, but was told the product could stain the teeth (which the dentist could alter back to white teeth), however, i wiped my teeth with a wash cloth after swishing with the product. the details were included in the two above sections."
1,"effectively lowers blood pressure with very few side effects and no cough, no drowsiness and no sexual problems of any kind!!! i have had some very mild side effects. slight nasal congestion (now gone) and an occasional sort of gravelly coarseness to my voice. if they are the only side effects then i am happy to live with that. i had been searching for a drug for hypertension that had the fewest side effects. every time i saw my doctor it was like i was being a guinea pig for the next lot of side effects and it was really getting me down. so after a little research on the net, i came across this drug and reviews from people who have taken it.
i told and showed my doctor the results and he was happy for me to try this drug and i am glad that i did. previous drugs gave me an instant irritating cough and also made my feet swell up.
this drug is by far the best i have tried so far and just one mg tablet a day does the trick for me!"

1,"the ranitidine was very effective in releaving my symptoms of acid reflux.  after several months of treatment my stomach, which previously felt nauseated on a daily basis, felt much better and very rarely caused me discomfort. i didnt seem to have any negative side effects. i am not sure if it is related to the ranitidine but since i began using it i have not contracted any viruses.  in the past i would get  or  viruses every year."
1,"sleeping was possible.  it works well without making me sleepy the next day like ambien did.  it also works quickly as long as you lie down right away. bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  however, lineage did not work well at all if i ate anything near bed.  the directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  but, it also did not work if i even took a fish oil supplement, which is a fatty acid.  even the smallest amount of fat, like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  when that happens, i would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  this is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half! taken as needed for insomnia."
1,the infection that developed at the site of my oral surgery subsided and this allowed the wound to begin to heal. none observed. the oral surgeon prescribed amoxicillin as a preventaitive measure after surgery.  i opted not to take a breaod spectrum antibiotic when there was no infection present.  within  days of surgery it was clear that i did have an infection and filled that prescription. i took  mg of amoxicillin  times daily and took probiotics at least two hours after each dose of antiobiotics to replace the body's good bacteria.  after a few days the infection cleared.  i finished the whole course as directed.

1,"i started using skinoren along with a treatment of benzoil peroxide and alpha hydroxy lotion as part of a regimen to attempt to clear up ongoing, stubborn adult acne. within about five or six days my skin started clearing up. my skin was already accustomed to high-percentage aha products, so any stinging scaling or irritation were minimal. after a few days i had no side effects. nightly, i would put a small amount of skinoren, benzoil peroxide and an aha cream (with a % aha)in the palm of my hand and combine, and apply to face nightly. the rest of my regimen included a very gentle face cleanser, and a mild and light moisturizer during the day along with an application of the % aha lotion."

neck pain i have been taking minocycline mg twice a day. at first i had no side effects what so ever. however after a week i started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. it was when i started having neck pains, i stopped using minocycline. although i stopped using it, i never thought the pains were due to it - i thought it was from going out right after the shower which i often do. that same night i woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) at first i thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (white blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)

during the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) i was taking steroid pills for allergies and i got back to normal within  days. on the th day, i was like hmm lets take minocycline again, i wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. i took one pill at night after  days of not using it, and the next day i got itchy hands and a few hives and then i realized it was the minocycline that i was reacting to. luckily i only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and i am back to normal again.



so around - days later after i gave blood, the results came to my doctor. to my surprise everything came normal no allergies what so ever, no pollen, no nuts, no nuts, no dust completely no allergies. my red blood cell count along with hematocrit came a little high but nothing else.

1,"this drug definately does have an effect on depression.  i went on a trip and while i had enough for the duration of the trip, i ran out the day i returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  i noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  although i tried to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" my husband noticed the change. at the beginning of treatment i noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and i felt a bit jittery.  however, i do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and i was told to expect this by my doctor.  another effect that i didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  i did not attribute this specifically to the medication until i had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken wellbutrin at one point.  she asked me specifically if i had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  i am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression. overall, i feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  i have not experienced any sexual side effects (which i know can occur with some antidepressants).  my libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before i began taking this drug.  i know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  my husband and i both smoke and i do smoke less when he is not home.  he is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if i want to go outside with him and smoke.  usually (not always) i say yes for the companionship but sometimes i decline.  when he is not home i will smoke approximately  cigarettes in an - hour period (i used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
overall, i feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  i began taking it after my father died.  he battled cancer for  years and i took care of him the entire time.  his loss was debilitating to me.  no pill is going to change what i went through or how i feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  my doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from ortho-tricyclen (which i was highly loyal to) to loestrin fe .  i must say that between these two drugs, physically i feel ten years younger (i am  but i feel  again).  overall i would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and i feel is appropriate for me."

1,"i had smoked for  years and despite repeated quit attempts using zyban (bupropion), nicotine patches (and nicotine gum, lozenges etc), i had never managed to stay quit for long. chantix enabled me to quit my  cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment i really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore. i was nauseated after taking each tablet. the nausea started about  minutes after taking the tablet and lasted for about  minutes. i was never physically sick and the nausea was bearable.
i had greatly reduced libido and difficulty getting and sustaining an erection. my orgasm was delayed, diminished and not satisfying. sexual function returned to normal when i finished the chantix course.

0,"it was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. it was recommended that i be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. this is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the lac-hydrin. unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions i've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. ultimately, i've found better results with the much cheaper eucerin and even curel moisturizing lines. during the  months during which i used the lac-hydrin, i didn't experience any negative side-effects. i was using it during winter months, so i don't have any feedback to offer on sun-sensitivity. i didn't experience any additional skin irritation that lessened my interest in the product. i simply moved on to other products because of the price. the lac-hydrin was applied topically to all parts of my body (expect my face) twice daily. my dermatologist recommended that one of the applications be directly after my shower. the skin will retain moisture from the shower for a bit, and the application of the lac-hydrin will help to keep it there. i would reapply to dry skin again before bed."

1,"i have seen a great improvement since taking zoloft.  i am a classic type a person and tend toward anxiety when i have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  i asked my physician about zoloft when my second child was  years old and i was under alot of stress at work.  i sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking zoloft.  another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that i think more clearly.  i don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work. i need to take my dose with breakfast.  if not, i feel nauseous.  this hasn't been a huge issue, since i eat breakfast regularly.  however, if i take a pill and eat immediately, i feel sick to my stomach.  the only other issue i have had is that i feel dizzy if i miss a dose.  i am good at remembering to take my morning dose, so this does not happen often.   also, i did go off zoloft a couple of years ago because i wanted to reduce the number of drugs i was taking.  although i gradually reduced my dosage, i had a difficult time when i finally went completely off.  i felt dizzy and suffered a couple of bouts of vertigo. i take  mg in the morning.  zoloft was prescribed to me by a family practice physician when i was  years old. the first  months that i took zoloft, my dosage was  mg.  i took a break for about  years and asked my physician abbout going back on zoloft last year, when i turned .  i was experiencing mood swings right before my period and, in doing research on the internet, learned that this could be due to my age.  one recommendation was treating the symptoms with zoloft or another prescription drug.  my physcian started me on  mg, and i went up to  mg after a few months of taking zoloft."

taken when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that slight mental and phyical sedation (positive effect for me but be careful if you need to be alert e.g driving)

slight mental fog for couple of hours on a higher dose (i wouldn't choose this particular benzodiazepine if i felt anxiety at work as i wouldn't be able to concentrate up to the standard required.) but perfect for every other situation. it's long lasting nature often means that if i am experiencing anxiety only one dose is enough to last through the night into the next day... and often it seems as though the body remembers and stores this relaxation so another dose is not necessary. 

i only take when needed which can mean i go months without a dose... this is important as for me personally if i see valium and other benzodiazepine drugs as a long term / life treatment its vital not to become addicted and dependant as this not only means needing a drug to function (shackled by a drug rather than using its benefits when really needed.)

but if your body has constant daily dosing for months or years your brain stopped producing natural relaxation chemicals meaning that you need more and more of the drug to get the same benefit and also because of this after years of high dosage extreme withdrawal symptoms can occur while the brain starts to produce these chemicals again."
1,more restful sleep. which helped me to be more alert during the day and less nervous and paniky thinking about my inability to sleep at night knowing i had to work the next day. slight groginess the first couple of days but other than that i actually felt more awaken because the sleep i received was deeper and allowed for me to be more restful when i awoke.  tab at night when needed one hour before bedtime.
1,"i had severe depression with agitation and mixed-state bipolar hypomania. i was insomniac. i took abilify mg for  mos, and then i upped it to mg. i became drowsy, however, with adequate sleep ( hrs) there were no hangover effects, unlike zyprexa, for instance. i also experienced some cognitive blunting- that is to say that i could not think very well on my feet the abilify decreased the need for daily klonopin. when i went off of it, i tapered down to mg for  weeks, then quit altogether. i had racing thoughts when i stopped, but these gradually diminished over several weeks. i also experienced about two months of hypomania, but this was goal-directed and positive for my functioning."

1,"kept the high blood pressure normal. of course patient has also changed lifestyle - exercising four times a week, eating light sodium and low calorie foods. diet of vegetables and fish or white chicken, fruits and grains, no red meats. we believe it is both lifestyle and medication that have lowered the high blood pressure. none that we can tell. one tablet of mg once a day"
1,"acute pain in tooth subsided normally within  minutes, and the relief lasted - hours.  allowed me to sleep the entire night without being awakened by the return of pain.

i was later prescribed codeine after the procedure, which only dulled the pain to half intensity. mild drowsiness accompanied by a sense of well-being or euphoria.  side effects were enjoyable, so i was especially careful to take it only as needed to reduce risk of dependency.  the combined effect of pain relief and ""nice feelings"" make this a risky drug to take if you are susceptible to addiction. prescribed by my dentist to ease pain until i could have a problematic wisdom tooth extracted.  received  tablets to be taken as needed for pain.  i took a half tablet when the pain was less severe and a whole one when i thought pain might interrupt sleep.

my back went out suddenly one day and i was unable to stand or walk without excruciating pain.  i took the last two vicodin in one dose and the moment i was able, went to a clinic where the doctor chastized me for having a narcotic.  the onset of pain relief was rapid, the side effects took longer to present, but when they did, they were more marked.  same amount of drowsiness, heavy limbs, and a trance-like state."
1,"it effectively slowed my hair loss dramatically. my barber of  years says my hair has not changed. i notice slight loss over the years, but i still have a lot of hair whereas i would most certainly be bald without it! none the cost is prohibitive for many. i took propecia for many years (with great results) until i went to a new doctor and he offered to prescribe it's generic counterpart finasteride. it costs about $ for a six months supply compared to propecia @ $ for a one month supply. the only drawback is that the pill only comes in mg, so you have to cut it into  doses of mg. for that kind of savings it was no problem for me and it's been working for me for about  years! if your doctor won't do it, fire him/her as they are probably on the payroll of big pharma!"
1,completely eliminated anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and generalized anxiety after dosage of  mg/day was taken.  downsside was that while on  mg/day start up dose for the first   days anxiety was extremely worsened and almost unbearable. initial weight loss patient taking  mg/day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks.  initial start up dose  mg/day for  days.   anxiety extremely heightened and patient almost disscontinued med because of it.  hung in there and pill started to decrease and finally eliminate anxiety.
1,"my head felt very clear for the first time in years. i didn't get rattled as easily. mood stabilizer is a very good description of it. i was able to get motivated, and not feel the world was ending every time something went wrong. i lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion. unfortunately i developed the much feared rash, and had to discontinue. i had recently started cymbalta, so i can't be sure it was the lamictal that set me off, but the psychiatrist didn't want to risk it. i did have to change the timing of the dose to bedtime, as it made me a bit tired shortly after i took it. also, i believe it affected my vision, which got a bit blurry sometimes. i spent years shuttling between ssri's, which i know know were the key element in tipping me into mania several times. after the psychiatrist determined the problem was bipolar , the first treatment she considered was lamictal. i did get some headaches at first, and unfortunately, at some point the effects were negated by the addition of adderal. once the adderal was stopped, it was all good again. i would recommend this drug to anyone, with the proviso that if the sjs rash shows up, you must stop it immediately. despite that, i really feel it is worth trying."
0,"there were none that i know. still has osteroposis.  had to stop because of the stomacjh effect. developed atrial fibrillation of the heart.  going to shock heart into proper rhythm.  looked down her throat with a camera to see if there was any blood clots around her heart.  ruptured her esophagus.  never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus, weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. when fixed, there was no more pain in the stomach.  she is alright now--but almost died from this see above for treatment details as i don't know what more i could say.  she is healthy now from this.  fosamax and this type of drugs are not very good for some people."
1,"anxiety greatly diminished shortly after taking alprazolam.  the alprazolam was also effective in calming the mind prior to sleep.  i have taken alprazolam for anxiety attacks, worrisome and obsessive thinking and in order to fall asleep. i noticed no adverse side effects other than an occassional grogginess the next day after taking it at night. the doctor prescribed alprazolam for anxiety, taken daily every  hours or as needed to treat immediate symptoms."

1,"panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. i wish i could keep on taking them indefinitely as i am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where i am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. i found sertraline completely ineffective for my ibs. after taking drug for  months i developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body, causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  these only occurred when i lay down - usually when i was in bed, but didn't occur when i was up and about moving around. i gave up taking sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious, it started to interfere with my sleep.  the condition took around  months to completely disappear."

0,not sure if it is effective or not.  pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  i am virtually unable to function by evening.  i think i may ask my physician to prescribe an additional mg to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon. slight grogginess in the am. starting pt in  days.  currently on flexeril qd hs x  days.
1,"almost immediate (i.e. within  minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. these patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  i have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. i use them only as a last resort. relief of pain!  no bad side effects. although the packaging indicates that up to  lidoderm patches can be used at one time for up to  hours in a  hour period, i have never used more then two patches, and then only rarely.  i usually use one patch and cut it into several pieces to fit specific areas. i have used one patch, cut into  pieces on my neck for up to  hours several times (i.e. replaced the first patch with a second at the end of a  hour period) during severe pain episodes, without any harmful side effects."
1,"overall acid reduction; however, it could be sporadic.  with taking the medication, still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.  at times, the medication was not effective. none symptoms were so severe they would wake me up in the middle of the night, gasping for breath at times.  this treatment reduced episodes such as this, but was not % effective at all times."

1,"i was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (no children, yet!) the fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  as an added bonus, i no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  i no longer suffer from pms symptoms, either.  i can not complain about this drug at all. i have not experienced any side effects from this medication.  losing my period was an anticipated side effect, and although many feel that this is too much for them and discontinue use of this drug, it is a good side effect for me.  also there are studies that show bone mineral density is affected by this drug, but i have undergone a bone density scan, with normal results.  this is great, considering i have been on depo for nine years now, since i turned nineteen and for most of my twenties. this drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year, by a physician.  the shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  besides being used as birth control, it is also used to treat other conditions."

0,"at first i loved this drug. panic attacks were getting under control and i didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed. there were no side effects that i noticed at the time. sadly, you can't (or shouldn't) take a drug like xanax forever. so eventually, after using it for four months, i stopped. omg. would someone please explain to me whose brilliant idea it was to create a drug that when you stop taking it, causes the same symptoms that it was designed to alleviate to begin with?!?! i ended up going through even worse panic attacks after stopping the drug than i had to begin with! so in spite of the fact that it worked great to begin with, i would never take this medication again. all in all it turned out to be a terrible experience. there are other far less addictive and nasty drugs available for anxiety."

1,"i never really had any complications with my disease. it seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. it also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has ulcerative colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. it really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. the side effects most likely worsened because i was on the drug for a long period of time. i had dry eyes, trouble gaining weight, and loss of energy. my doctor had me start out by taking  tablets a  day, three at breakfast and three at dinner. after  and a half months he had me start taking  tablets a day and / a pill less every week, until i was down to / a pill a day for a week. after that i stopped taking the pills."

1,"venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. it works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. the neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that snris may also increase dopamine transmission. this is because snris work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. if the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then snris will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex). difficulty in reaching orgasm. increased amount of ejaculate. rare mild headache. my uptake levels were not severely out of balance. i started with  mg and felt the positive effects in  minutes. i was told it would take a week. i reduced the dosage to  mg then . mg after six months because i felt those doses to be too strong. i know others that found this drug helpful. others it had no effect on at all, even at doses of  mg."

i know once i took parlodel and stopped and then took a prolactin test h later and the levels were higher then without taking any meds.
so best is to decrease dosage slowly and not suddenly. i think this is the case with any ergot derivative. taken for  months. once daily, but half a tablet of . mg was taken after a while to reduce side effects. i found the best way to get a stable prolactin levels and best improvement was to take half a tablet once in morning and once in evening.

1,"helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  the sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the celexa was stopped.  ever since taking the celexa my nervous system has been exquisitely sensitive, with symptoms such as pain, heart palpitations, restless legs, and other such things that totally interrupted my ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. none used - mg at bedtime."
0,"i had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep. i took tramadol once, that's all it took for me to decide i didn't want to take it again.  i took it in the evening and went to sleep a few hours later, it made me very sleepy.  upon waking up in the morning i felt extremely nauseous, shaky and - it's hard to explain, i felt inside my head a lot.  very cloudy headed.  i thought i'd feel better if i took a shower but ended up throwing up b/c i just couldn't stand up, all i wanted to do was lie down.  i felt very dizzy. i laid down for about  mins and felt a little better, stomach was still upset though.  i ate something and immediately felt nauseous, was shaking uncontrollably and sweating.  i threw up again.  the episodes continued through most of the day.  but i felt better as time went on.  i decided the side effects just aren't worth it! overall tramadol just isn't work the side effects i experienced.  i'd rather take a few aleve and deal with the left over pain."

mood swings; l-thyroxine was supposed to increase the low production of thyroid hormones, which was a result of hypothyroidism, as well as to help lower the number of antithyroid antibodies (which indicate the autoimmune disease that may be damaging the thyroid gland).

1,"the prevention of pregnancy was the benefit in addition to almost completely eliminating a monthly menstrual cycle.  other than that, there were no other benefits involved in taking this medication.  the benefits at the time that i was taking this drug outweighed the risks. however, at this time, the risks and side effects now outweigh the benefits. after going off of the birth control pill, i noticed an elevation of mood.  when i began taking the pill after being off of it for a while, i noticed the difference in my mood.  my mood is much more consistently positive when not on the drug.  in addition, now that i am older, i have no desire to take this medication as the potential side effects/risks are too high for women who are +. the risks that most concern me are risk of blood clots and stroke even though i have never been a smoker. i took the birth control pill for approximately  years fairly consistently. there were periods of time during those  years when i did not take the drug.  i am no longer taking the birth control pill and do not currently see this as a viable option for me given my age and potential side effects."

1,"xanax took the edge off of the anxiety without causing drowsiness or interfering with thought process. the anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of  years prior. calendar dates were going to be of importance. there were none whatsoever except the anxiety returned when the drug wore off and when i was anxious my memory recall was negatively affected. xanax was prescribed for me because i was a plaintiff in litigation and my accurate testimony was imperative, especially memory recall of specific dates  years prior to my testimony. the defense attorney was a rude and nasty old man and was deliberately trying to confuse me to the point of tears. my attorney had warned me beforehand about the defense attorney's tactics so i asked my doctor for a short term tranquilizer. during recesses in my testimony ( days) i would take a xanax to keep me focused. it worked like a charm and i won the case. it just seemed to keep me sharp, rather than sedated."

1,my dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated. some light nasal bleeding and a dry mouth when not taken precisely as directed.  it's important not to let the medication go too far into the nasal passage so that it doesn't go down the back of the throat which will lead to dry mouth. when i began taking flonase i was experiencing at least annual sinus infections and waking frequently from a dry/choking cough.  the coughing is a very rare occurence for me after taking flonase and i have significantly fewer sinus infections.

1,"a dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  there were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  in addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically. the most troublesome side effect was faintness upon rising quickly from a seated (or horizontal) position.  on one occasion i lost consciousness and fell.  however, this side effect went away after three months or so.  there was also some decrease in sexual desire, but this side effect also lessened over time.  a side effect that seems to be permanent is lower blood pressure, but this is actually a benefit for most people.  i've been told that some people take maoi's solely to decrease their blood pressure. it takes some time to build up to a clinical dosage.  as i recall, my doctor had me take mg for a weak, mg for two weeks, mg for two weeks until i had built up to mg.  i did not begin to feel the antidepressant effect until i reached mg. when i reached mg the antidepressant effect had kicked in fully and i even experienced a period (two or three weeks) of a mild euphoria, which i have been told is fairly typical.  my doctor thought that a slow buildup of the drug in my system was the most effective treatment.  he also had me taking lamictal (mg per day), which he thought might spark a stronger reaction to nardil.  there are also some diet restrictions: no aged cheeses and no aged meats.  also, some cold medications must be avoided."
1,daily anxiety lessened considerably. when stressful situations arise i am better able to handle them although i am still able to feel somewhat anxious which is good. i don't want to be a zombie with no feelings at all. there is a possibility of elevated blood pressure but my medication for the blood pressure seems to be doing the job. i just take  pill daily.
1,"zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my ""why me"" or ""i suck"" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same. there was a definite decrease in sexual desire and performance, but it is hard to say if the zoloft is to be blamed for everything. i was put on zoloft while still in the hospital having suffered a traumatic brain injury. i was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me, and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft, because i knew i was going to be depressed. i continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. when i stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) i went on living ok, but was still depressed. i was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery, so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use, but i eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. there is something to be said for a natural high, but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus."

0,"none.  had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects! within hours of taking the first dose i had vaginal itching.  since i read that was a side effect in the paperwork, i didn't think much of it.  after two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  i thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  the medication was taken at bedtime.  when i woke up after taking the third dose, i had blisters on the outer labia.  late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, i was in severe pain.  the blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  during the drive, i felt so bad i was praying for my life so i could continue to raise my children, even though i do not believe in god!  it is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  my blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and i have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  i have not taken my temperature but i'm sure i have one.  i feel like i have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  i'm no doctor, but i highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use immediately upon any gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.  the goose eggs in my bikini area continue to grow and become more tender. my neurologist that prescribed the med told me to see my primary gyn if symptoms are not gone a week after discontinuation.  isn't that nice!  i live in a rural town and don't have an established gyn right now so it just is not a good situation.  beware!!!"

0,"so far, i have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and pms symptoms.  i can't say it's all due to the prozac, as i'm employing cbt methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and i generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  i'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms i'm experiencing.  it's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when i don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring. immediately after beginning treatment i experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  due to this, i lost  pounds in a  week period (worrisome because i am a normal weight).  about a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then i noticed i was feeling very stimulated. it was as if i could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. soon after this began, i started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  generally the tremoring subsides when i am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when i start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) i tend to feel it more.  at first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.  no sexual side effects noted yet. i was prescribed prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began, i went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  the psychiatrist had said some people react to prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  i also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in prozac users.  i go back to my psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill, the side effects i'm experiencing, and whether or not we should continue."

i still would never attempt to work outside the house, the stress level would tip me over. i don't have panic attacks anymore unless a major confrentational situation arises. weight gain large weight gain, dry mouth, even when i am exhausted i cannot sleep with out this combination of drugs. i am worried about the side effects that may acure which the doctor explained, liver fuction altered, diabetes, seizures, weight gain. fortnightly visit to psychiatrist, just a general chat, but when something tips me over like my brother dying, or my eldest son has a bad temper and says very aggressive and rude conversation, my nerves, panic attack, depths of despair, at those times i require a session with her and also take a different medication, once of.(serequel)"
0,"this did nothing for my dry eyes, which cause me to have blurry vision at times. stinging when first applied, lasting approximately  minutes, and some redness. this medication is very expensive.  without insurance expect to pay between $ - $ for a month supply, depending on which pharmacy you use.  even with insurance it costs me $ a month.  if you read the insert that comes with the drops it states that clinical trials show only % of patients show improvement.  had i read that before i wasted the money on  montjs worth of this stuff i wouldn't have even bothered.  waste of money!"

0,"there were little to no benefits to using differin to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differin, using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  my acne worsened using differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  i don't know if i completely buy this theory though i would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  unfortunately, it did not. there were no side effects to the treatment except that it worsened my breakouts.  however, it did nothing to take down the flares even after three months of treatment.  soon after i stopped using it, my skin improved.  so now, i choose to use an exfoliation product and a separate over the counter acne treatment product. differin did not help prevent acne or get rid of current acne.  it worsened the condition though it was explained that as it helped the skin exfoliate, the impurities beneath the outer skin surfaced.  however, there were no improvements after three months of application."

0,"mild improvement of symptoms, however the symtoms were not eliminated.  this required a second treatment of the antibiotic a month later.  again the symtoms persisted.  a third tretament was taken  months later again.  this appeared to have eliminated any chronic symptoms. none take one tablet daily until the pack was complete."
1,the symptoms of the gastritis resolved completely within  hours after the first dose and were not experienced at all while on the treatment. there were no troublesome side effects compromising compliance. the once daily dose was also ameanable to comlpeting the course of treatment with ease. none were encountered thus ensuring compliance as stated above. the once daily dose was extremely effective in controlling the debilitating symptoms of gastritis and maintaining the symptom-free period while the treament was taken. there were no side-effects encountered which would have otherwise compromised compliance. the treatment is highly recommended!

0,"none.  i had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit. the only good point i suppose is that there was no adverse reaction, such as yeast infection or stomach upset. the downside was the bacterial infection quickly got worse. absoutely innefective.  i easily could have been takign a sugar pill for those results.  bacterial infection became coniderably worse and was later put on another antibiotic to relieve symptoms."

0,i found tramadol quite effective before and after surgey to reconstruct my knee (acl). side effects however ocurred almost straight away on intial dose of mg.the worst of which is a constant feeling of tiredness and lack of energy.this has not subsided even after a year of taking this medaction. other side effects i have experienced are blurred vision and on the rare occasion mild muscle spasms.i also have found this drug to be addictive with a feeling of nervousness mixed with mild depression if a dose is missed. mg twice daily seems to work well for myself however if you can get away with taking co codamol i would recomend this first. co codamol worked wonders for me for the first  months however i soon built up a very high tolerance and was taking mg of codiene  times a day to get any effect hence the change to tramadol.

0,"my migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. there was a clear inverse correlation between my neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines) i was a zombie. some aspects of this subsided over the first year, however others did not. my vocabulary suffered horribly and never really recovered. i went from being a very well spoken person to someone struggling to grasp some words over three letters. coworkers even mentioned to me that they noticed this effect. my memory suffered horribly as well. i would have to cut back on my dosage during exam times (i was in school as well as working at the time). there seemed to be absolutely no way for me to memorized the volume of work i needed to while on this drug.

the sleepiness i experienced was awful. this diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years i took it. a couple of times i had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. the sleepiness was overwhelming at times. i once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. while on neurontin i also had an annoying tendency to forget what i was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. since abandoning neurontin and switching to lamictal i no longer have this problem. used as a migraine prophylactic, my dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what i believe was mg. per day up to  over approximately two months. i was to take the medicine throughout the day but i sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. unfortunately no matter when i took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! this decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. i will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. but i opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself. unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times i told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside. it did lessen but never subsided to a safe level. she's no longer my physician and i now take lamictal."
1,"for the most part, the pressure feeling i constantly had in my bladder went away.  sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  instead of having to go to the bathroom - times during the night, i was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night. i would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when i spoke.  also, your throat is dry and irratated.  it's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  my mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable. i was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  i take the medicine once a day.  i guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while i felt like i should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  i am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  i did this kind of therapy  years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--i'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication."
1,"the idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  at day  the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  i did this and found that in fact by day  or  i felt an eversion to smoking.  
niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
the prescription is typically for  months but i didn't need any refills at all.  i stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
i recommend this drug only under the care of a physician to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money. the most obvious side effect for me was difficulty sleeping.  
hard to take but i knew that it would be temporary and i knew that i would rather have spotty sleep for as much as a few weeks in trade for not smoking ever again.
the difficulty sleeping didn't last long into the treatment, though.  a week maybe.  
i remember reading about other side effects like a dry mouth, but the most alarming one is possible seizures.  talk to your doctor. treatment details are above (oops).  
once a day for three days and twice a day (twelve hours apart) for up to three months after that.
at day ten the patient should stop smoking cold turkey."

1,"these drugs eliminated hot flashes;they also appeared to help with restlessness,sleeplessness and made it possible for the patient to live a 'normal'life as if menopause was not happening. no side effects of any kind was experienced,neither when premarin was taken on its own or when combined with provera.the patient was even reluctant to discontinue the drugs at the doctor's recommendation after so many years of use,also due to a concern about osteporosis which is in the family.patient is in exellent health after having used the drugs for about  years! treatment commenced when the patient was only just ,at which time the symptoms vere already beginning to be very severe.the daily doses were started at  that time,for a while premarin only,and after about a year provera was added,at the patient's requests,based on results of personal research which recommended a combination of the two.after using the drugs for nearly  years they were discontinued,the patient feeling they had been of great benefit."
1,"can get a good nights rest and anxiety attacks are supressed. i have been able to lead a normal life and be successfull. i am doing my doctoral now in medical research and belief without azor it would not be possible. i remember what my life was before azor and am relieved to know it is behind me. i have been on it for years now, the benefits outweighs the disadvantages- i know im addicted. azor was and still is prescribed to me by my psychiatrist. some lethargic tendencies and drowsiness at times when taken for anxiety attack. also, i am addicted to it. i can not sleep witout azor. i take one tablet (.g) azor whenever i have a anxiety attack or struggle to sleep. 
i was attacked a few years back, and still have panic attacks on occasion and struggle to sleep considerably. in addition, i have nightmares. however, when i take the azor, i calm down. furthermore,i did try sleeping medication, however,i was always tired and struggled to wake up. when i take azor, i can sleep without the whooziness the following morning."
1,"i took alprazolam for  months for extreme anxiety/depression. it did work considerably in the beginning, however i would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. i would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. it did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. in retrospect, i shouldn't have taken the medication because i was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because i have an addictive personality. i discussed this with my dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. i later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. also, i've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. i think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. i don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. if you have an addictive personality like myself, i think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. but exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, i think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. i suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. i only say this because i know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are very unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx.  hours. i will also say gladly, that i have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. the bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. best of luck. lethargy, loss of appetite. i was started at .mg, the second strength of dosage,  times daily. i became afraid of it because i was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, i was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression."

0,"topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the elavil i was taking as sleep med.  elavil and effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  i was taking mg elavil each night.  the goal was to completely switch from elavil to topamax.  topamax also had the added benefit of preventing migraines which i am prone to because of my hydrocephalis caused by a sub arachnoid cyst. i have a vp shunt i had to stop increasing the dose of topamax when i reached mg because i experienced peripheral neuropathy in my fingertips and also blurred vision.  i am now taking  mg topamax and mg elavil hs. the switch from elavil to topamax was slow and painful and not altogether successful, but i almost immediately experienced a lb weight loss as a result.

i was told to increase topamax in mg doses every week.  when excessive sedation was experienced, i was to cut back mg of elavil.  i proceeded like this until i reached a topamax dose of mg and elavil mg, but i wasn't sleeping at night and my vision was blurred and my fingers tingled.  the doses were fine tuned to a comfort level of mg topamax and  elavil to this date.  switching the effexor to cymbalta is the next phase, all in the name of decreasing the carbohydrate cravings....wish me luck!"

1,"less urinary urgency (worked as advertised). the only side effect was a dry mouth.this was mildly annoying, but not serious. although the drug was supposed to be good for  hours, it seemed to wear off during the second  hours. a switch to plain detrol (mg) twice a day proved to work much better."
1,"it helped with the itchy watery eyes and congestion none used the claritin d  hours seems to work better than the  hour.  overall with continued use my allegies seem to diminish, liek the sneezing and runny nose, itchy eyes.  i mostly have seasonal outdoor allegies.  i'm ot allegic to pets or other similar things so i'm not sure how effecive it would be on those symptoms."

0,"according to thyroid tests that i take every year, the combination of levothyroxine and cytomel are keeping my hypothyroid under control. none that i am aware of. it took some trial and error to find the right combination of drugs to treat my hypothyroid, but once we started the combo of levothyroxine and cytomel, my tests show that everything is under control.  i take the one pill of each one first thing in the morning with lots of water before eating anything.  i have to wait  minutes before i eat breakfast.  the hardest part is that i have to wait  hours before i take any calcium pills, which means i often forget to take my calcium."
0,"lower levels of sciatiaca pain. light lifting of depression. also helped slightly with anger gas headaches high blood pressure. overall feeling of severe agitaion( really want to hit or break something) severe depression from being molested. severe back pain. social withdrawal. i think agitation side effects are from stopping wellbutrin. i was addicted to morphine, percoset, xanax adipex and testoserone(inj). psch now thinks i'm bipolar. heard many terrible stories bout stopping cymbalta. be careful with this one i felt better being on crazy strong cocktail of mg morphine,  mg of percos,-mg injections of testosteron,  mg of adipex and mg of xanax daily. life sux now. not used to having to control my temper. never wanted to be a junkie but not sure its not better than tearing someones head off..literally!"

1,"this drug does an excellent job of relieving my headache pain.  no otc drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  what i used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  if i could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when i woke up.  problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  this prescription relieves pain completely within  minutes. i feel kind of spacey for about an hour after i take it.  do not recommend driving, or trying to think or make decisions during this time.

in addition, i am worried about getting hooked on it.  i find now that i am taking these pills more often.  also, i notice that now i cannot tolerate headache pain without these pills... same pain as before only now i just can't handle it at all. i have (what i think is) sinus-related headache pain.  pain is always in the forehead on the right side.  changes in barometric pressure always bring a headache on.  sometimes the pain is so bad i vomit.  i had sinus surgery (drilled holes in sinus cavities in forehead... sorry i don't know the medical terminology).  this relieved the headache problem for about  years, but it is  back again.  i think i would rather have another surgery than continue to take these pills."
1,"neurontin helped prevent hypomania and headaches.  neurontin allowed me to feel less like i was aboard a runaway train.  i was able to back off enough so that i was able to move normally.  it also helped with the headache associated with a subdural hematoma. none when i was on depakote for bipolar d/o we added neurontin mg tid and within a few days i had a noticable lessening of hypomanic symptoms.  after i had a subdural hematoma associated with severe headaches, we incrreased the dose of neurontin to mg tid and there was almost complete amelioration of symptoms."
0,"my doctor prescribed lexapro to treat my condition of major depression disorder (mmd.)  in addtion to major depression disorder, i also have anxiety disorder, and prior to treatment, i occassionally get into hyperventilation. i felt better after several days into taking lexapro, and i was able to sleep better also. i had nobody to take me to my doctors' offices, so i had to drive myself around. the sedation side effect was very strong on me, and i could not drive safely. my friends also made comments that my responsiveness had gone a lot worse at that time.  by the third week into taking lexapro, i had to call my doctor and requested to have a different drug in replacement. to treat the major depression disorder and anxiety disorder, i visited my psychologies on a weekly basis, and my psychiatrist once every two or three weeks. the first drug that the psychiatrist recommended was lexapro, and i started with the  mg dosage, after which i took the  mg for about three weeks. as mentioned above, i had to call my psychiatrist by the third week to request a different drug due to significant side effects."
1,inhibits allergic reactions none i used it prior to bedtime every day in order to prevent allergic reactions and sinus infections
1,"in short, the patient recovered. the patient sometimes used to report higher grades of blood pressure, anxiety and headache. also reported to have back ache some times.

with alprazolam for  weeks.
ant with beta blocker, for management."
1,what i really like about this medication is that it cleared up my sinuses. i no longer experience the tingling feeling that i had in my cheeks and around my lip area. i am also very happy that the medication helped me with my allergies to dust and to the effects of dry air on my nose. it stopped my nightly nose bleeds. there were two side effects to the drug. the first side effect was that i was very drowsy. i knew that this would be a side effect and so that is why i took the medication about a half hour to an hour before bed. another side effect was an increase in appetite. i gained a few pounds because of an increase in appetite. for the treatment i was given a few options as to how i could take the medication. one option was to take / of the medicine at night and take a tablet of zyrtec during the day time. another option was that i could take / at night without the zyrtec during the day. i was also allowed to take / a table to  whole tablet daily. i tried all of these and the one that worked the best for me was taking / a tablet at night everyday.
1,presumably my high colesterol was lowered as a result of taking this medication. i did not feel any side effects. my doctor regularly takes a blood test to make sure that there are no unseen effects but that did not happen for me. i was advised to take  mg once a day in the evening after dinner. the only reccommendation was not to have grapefruit as that might affect the potency of the medication.
1,"this drug after it reached therapeutic levels in my body resulted in a lifting of my depression. i was able to function in life in a more normal way. i ""just felt like doing things"". before i was struggling to get things accomplished. i felt jittery at first. i also had excessive salivation for several weeks. these side effects passed after three weeks. sexual i had more difficulty gaining an erection and it was very difficult reaching orgasm. made me feel jittery at first. also excessive salivation. it took about  weeks for this to pass. two months depression lifted."

0,"i did not feel that the original diagnosis was correct. i went to the doctor for tooth pain and he chose to treat me for tmj of which i disagreed. as it turned out the diagnosis was incorrect as i eventually had the tooth pulled and all pain stopped. i did not complete the suggested treatment plan due to mild side effects listed below. the most uncomfortable was tingling in my arms and legs. otherwise it was the general feeling that foreign drugs were in my body as i do not usually take any kind of drugs. the treatment being described as above. i consider it to be a mis-diagnosis and was quite disappointed that a medical m.d. who not consider that i knew my own body well enough to know what was really wrong. hence, i was diagnosised and prescribed incorrectly. knowing this i did not follow through on the treatment plan. the only reason i decided to take the meds in the first place was because a nurse friend of mine also convinced me i should take the meds. they were both wrong."
1,"before tamsulosin, i was getting up to urinate from  to  times a night. now i can sleep all throught he night without getting up to urinate! perhaps a little dizziness to begin with. as far as stuffy nose, i get sinus infection in the winter, so no way to tell if drug is affecting that. went to my physician. he did digital exam. prostate appeared normal, but physician said i could have swelling on side or prostate he cannot feel. he prescribed tamsulosin. it did the job! don't remember if  a day was doing the trick, but  a day certainly is! but be careful about taking . you have to work up to it slowly!"

1,"was placed on ritalin due to extreme fatigue assosicated with fibromyalgia.
medication highly effective in overcoming lack of energy and the tiredness that would never seem to go away.
the fatigue was worse than the physical pain associated with fibromyalgia. well tolerated--none i take  mgs in am and noon and  mg late afternoon.
this medication has given me a life back and am forever grateful to be on it.
this medication sometimes gets a bad rap and does not appear to be used widely for the treatment of fibromyalgia, but for me it is a true, true positive medication with no side effects."

1,"it cured the rash around my upper lip and chin area i personally had no side effects. this is a low dose tetracycline antibiotic, so you should avoid the sunlight and tanning beds while taking it.  it's typical side effects are the same as any antibiotic. i took the prescribed dose for  months(even though my dermatologist said i could stay on it indefinitely). the rash disappeared within - weeks.i was very pleased with the medication.  it has been  / years since my breakout and so far i have not had the rash return."

1,"it reduces the frequency of episodes of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. the most common side effects are reactions at the injection site, which i have had, especially at the beginning of treatment. these are redness, a lump or firmness, soreness, or itching at the site of injection. once i developed a permanent depression at an injection site, which is caused by a localized destruction of fat tissue. some patients (i never have) develop a short term reaction experienced immediately after injecting this medicine. this reaction  includes a feeling of warmth and/or redness known as flushing, chest tightness or pain with heart palpatations, anxiety, and trouble breathing. these symptoms may last a few minutes then go away by themselves without any further problems. each package of copaxone contains a complete list of possible side effects, or you may obtain this list from your doctor or pharmacist. each single use blister pack of copaxone contains one prefilled syringe containing  mg of copaxone (glatiramer acetate) which the patient self administers subcutaneously, in the fatty layer of skin, once a day. it is important to rotate injection sites daily."
1,"once i was diagnosed properly and began taking the synthroid, my dry skin cleared up, my energy level increased and my depression lifted.  my hair is now thick and shiny again.  i did not have weight gain so i cannot comment on that. i did not experience any side effects.  my doctor is very hesitant to give me the generic version as there are many cmplaints that the generic version does not relive symptoms. i take one pill every morning with a very large glass of water.  i must wait one hour before eating or drinking anything but water.  i take this pill at the same time every morning and it took about  to  weeks to begin feeling better.  i must get regular, every months, bloodwork to check thyroid levels."
1,"i was able to eat without nausea and vomiting after meals.  i was able to regain lost weight.  i was able to eat normal sized meals again. i had no side effect with the treatment.  the only drawback was the need to eat within  minutes of taking the medication.  there were times when an unavoidable delay in the mealtime made it necessary to eat something else in the interim. i didn't have usual gerd symptoms of heart burn.  i was skeptical that my stomach was producing too much acid.  i tried other home remedies like drinking diluted apple cider after a meal that seemed to work at times but didn't always.  after my doctor prescribed prilosec, it took several weeks before relief was complete.  i am still taking the medication but have scaled back to  mg just once a day."

1,"well controlled seasonal allergies and improved breathing.  i was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing, especially while working out, also improved.  years later i was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  i had noticed i had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until i started taking the claritin.  then running became much easier, so it now makes sense to me that the claritin helped so much. none that i recall - was before claritin became otc.  i really liked taking the claritin because i had no side effects, unlike some other allergy medicines i had taken earlier, and unlike some otc i had tried earlier.  when taking the claritin i felt that i was not really taking anything.  it was just easier to go about my daily routine and enjoy sports a lot more. i have really appreciated how claritin has helped me. the treatment details were very simple as far i can remember.  one pill once a day.  i stayed on the claritin for at least three years.  i do not recall any side effects or problems during this time.  eventually it seemed as if i didn't have any allergies because i had gotten so used to the positive effects of taking this medication."
1,"nerve pain and muscle pain decreased significantly within the first couple days.  fibromyalgia was very debilitating for me but with lyrica, i was able to go back to work and function normally.  it helped with pins and needles, twitching, and muscle spasms.  it also seemed to help with some of the anxiety i experienced. constipation mainly.  i didn't gain or lose weight.  a little dry eyes and mouth.  i did have several colds the second year so it may have lowered my immunity.  these side affects was worth the benefits for me i was first given  mg once a day and realized the medicine didn't last  hours so i started on twice daily doses and that helped.  i needed a little more pain reliever and started tramadol along with the lyrica.  i would take extra tramadol if necessary, which provided relief at times when pain spiked."
1,"was getting up to urinate - times a night to urinate. now can sleep through the night getting up not at all or one time. excellent results - could not be happier. dr. did digital exam, but felt no abnormality, but said hypertrophy could be on side he could not palpate, so to try tamsulosin. it worked! i did not experience any side effects to speak of took as prescribe. i started off with one capsule per day, then, as soon as possible, went to two capsules per day. two capsules per day did the trick. am able to sleep through the night the majority of the time!"
1,"the benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  it took almost two months for the benefits to kick in, but when they did it was well worth it.  the depression also decreased significantly.  i'm not sure if that was due to the addition of wellbutrin, or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression. there were several side effects worth noting.  first of all, the lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect, as did the addition of wellbutrin.  weight gain also occurred, as well as a severe decrease in libido.  when weaning off of the lexapro, severe dizziness occurred.  mg of lexapro (daily) was prescribed.  it was taken every day for nearly two years, in conjunction with check-ups with the prescribing psychiatrist every six months.  (the psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situational.  therefore, regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  after two years on the medication, treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  during the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.  the only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a lexapro pill.  as the weening continued, dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  eventually, the dizziness ceased completely."
1,"strength returning, clarity, ability to breath improved it took two days before any of the symptoms got better the doctor only prescribed the exact dosage and days.  one tablet every day for  days.  i was disheartened that my health insurance only paid  - % of the cost of the medication because it was a very expensive mediaction.  every time i took a pill i felt like i was swallowing a  dollar bill."

1,"my chlamydia went a way and i made a complete recovery. my acne also temporarily went away, which was good. however, it did come back after i stopped taking it, which meant it was somewhat useless. i had diahrea and some stomach upsets....while i wasn't taking it for my acne, it seemed to have helped it. however, the diahrea is something i've had with most antibiotics. i countered it by having acidophilus supplements, which worked really well. none i can describe, just took two tablets a day. one before breakfast and one before dinner. the treatment lasted ten days and i took it religiously. i did have to take other acidophilus containing products to control the side effects but it was fortunate that it lasted only  days."
1,the treatment remedied her lab values as well as treated her symptoms of weight gain and lack of energy. patient occasionally feels a bit shakey. patient was treated for low thyroid test results which coincided with the onset of menopause which manifested itself in a weight gain of # and a marked lack of energy.  the medication corrected her lab values and contributed to her ability to lose the weight gained and feel an increase in energy.

1,"this drug lowered my mild hypertension to normal range slight cough, especially at night i was prescribed this dose five years ago.  i have been taking it daily ever since.  it works.  ordinarily, when i check my blood pressure, it is in the normal range.  the common side effect, caused by excess production of mucus, is no big problem."
0,"stopped thinking that caused panic attacks and delusions. helped me be able to parent effectively again. weight gain, loss of interest in creative activities, loss of interest in sex, loss of interest in work, inability to work, inability to feel or think or behave beyond the very basic requirements of living. overall the drug is zombifying and has made me numb. inability to work has lead to the worst side effect of all... poverty on the pension for me and my children.  i take mg tegretol daily (mood stabiliser... the doctors don't like to see me cry or look angry)."
0,"the benefits were simple--none i can't really comment on the side effects of this sleep-aid. i haven't had the pleasure of yawning. i read carefully over the booklet and the website, thinking that maybe i was doing something wrong. i took the lunesta along the zanaflex hoping for a better result and, none!! took it at pm and :am, im still going strong-not even a yawn! i was formally on ambian, which would take over an hour to kick in, but my sleep time was averaging about two hours."
0,"lowering high cholesterol impotence i have a family history of high cholesterol. and i have high cholesterol as well.  in order to reduce the high cholesterol readings down to normal levels for cholesterol, my health care physician prescribed cholesterol reducing drug.  we tried zocor for a while.  however, when taking zocor at  mg per day, i experience significant problems with impotence.  i reported this to the doctor and the doctor had not receive any feedback like this before.  my prescription for high cholesterol was changed to lipitor."

1,"a muscle in my neck was pinching a nerve such that  if i turned my head or lay on that side my arm would instantly start to tingle and my hand fall asleep.  the flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely. i do not feel that i experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the flexeril.  if i was tired, the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy, and if i took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. but, to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do. i was prescribed flexeril (mg) for a muscle spasm in my neck that was pinching a nerve to my right arm.  i took the ten miligrams of flexeril three times a day for about a month as needed as it was prescribed. then, as the symptoms lessened to the point where they only bothered me on and off, i took the ten miligrams only once or twice a day depending on how my neck felt for about another month, and finally, during the next month, i only took it when i started to feel like the symptoms might be coming back, which was maybe once or twice a week.  since then, i have not experienced any symptoms, and it has been over a year."
0,"when i am in highly stressful situations, i start to cry.  i took xanax at times when i knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  i did not cry at all, my eyes didn't even water.  this has never happened with any other medication. while the drug did give the desired effect, i was groggy and tired.  the worst side effect would be that i had short-term memory loss during when i took it.  i would see notes that i took at the time and not remember writing them and had trouble remembering the details of conversations i had at the time. dr. suggested i take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when i did that, i still cried during the stressful situations."
1,"i had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  every dentist i saw  told me i was going to lose my teeth.  this drug  cleared up the condition.  it protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that i took it.  i continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. the effectiveness did not seem to diminish. none. a dentist in my dental hmo prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because i implored him to do so."
1,"much more effective than synthroid in raising body temperature, relieving fatigue, and weight loss none take once per day in the morning"
1,"this medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than ssris or snris i have tried.  also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, - months) which i experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  the facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain. one of the most unfortunate side effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for many people is weight gain.  i was 'lucky' that i did not gain weight, but i was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

the medication also increased my heart rate.  i was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  taking it in the am seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night). i began at mg then worked up to a mg dose.  i had relatively good suppression of depressive symptoms at all doses, higher doses being better.  the higher doses did not seem to increase the weight gain/heart rate side effects any more than the lower doses (as in non-dose-dependent effects)."
1,"wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. i have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects. side effects included mild nausea and shakiness. these side effects disappeared after about two weeks. i have been on wellbutrin for four years and will probably continue use for several more years."
0,"prevented pregnancy breakthrough bleeding, headaches, extreme breast tenderness, breakouts. i was very skeptical about taking seasonique, because some friends of mine had taken it in the past and did not have good experiences. however, i had always experienced heavy periods and cramping, even after trying  different birth controls so i decided to give it a try. my doctor assured me that seasonique was safe and i shouldn't have any severe side effects. after only a couple weeks, i started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. i didn't think much of it at first, but then i started experiencing more side effects. i have been blessed with great skin, only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. however, after being on seasonique for about a month, i started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. i didn't want to stop taking birth control, so i figured i would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. about a month and a half into taking seasonique, i began to breakthrough bleed. i had a full blown period for exactly  weeks. i consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. while on seasonique, i could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. for these reasons, i would not recommend seasonique to anyone."

0,"i had been on quasense (a generic for a different type of extended bc) and liked it a lot but i noticed when i would go off the pill (for period) i would get extreme migraines when my hormones fluctuated.  switched to seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  nope.  after the first three months i had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  i gave it three more months but had the same results.  the good news?  not pregnant. i experienced a number of side effects without even connecting it to the pill.  once i read about all the side effects online it was an ""ah ha"" moment.  weight gain --i am a runner and eat well and i have gained  pounds in six months.  i workout - times a week and didn't change my diet and couldn't figure it out.  i look forward to losing those extra lbs!  acne --terrible acne.  i've never had a problem with my skin and my face exploded.  i had big cysts on my cheeks.  i also experienced night sweats.  i cannot recommend seasonique. one pill a day at the same time each day."
1,"the benefits to the treatment was temporary relief of pain due to unknown infection in jaw area. though no other drugs were taken to address the infection, the prescribed drug did alleviated the pain until the condition improved. eventually a root canal was performed and i received a second prescription. the only noticeable side effect was that i became drowsy when taking the drug and  had to lay down throughout the day.  as i was unable to work under these conditions,  i did not have to perform usual task, therefore it is hard to measure what i would or would not have been able to do while taking the pain killer. i went to my dentist complaining of immense pain and swelling in my jaw area.  an x-ray was performed and nothing could be detected.  however, due to my symptoms, hydrocodone/ibuprofen was prescribed.  i was sent home with a follow up visit  scheduled.  the swelling and pain decreased within a few days, i discontinued taking the drug and i was able to continue normal activities.  however, approximately a week later the symptoms returns and i returned to dentist.  this time the x-ray revealed a need for a root canal. i continued to use the remaining tablets until my root canal, when i received a second prescription of hydrocodone/ibuprofen which i only used a few of the  tablets prescribed."

1,"as having surgery, my mounth experienced excruiating pain. i was without them for  hours. these seemed like the worst day of my life. after taking the pills i noticed one of two things occured. one, the pain was gone soon after taking them. two, i became extremely tired. first i thought that it was only like this because i just had surgery, but no. it seemed as though everytime i taken a pill i needed a nap soon after. don't get me wrong, i would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. this stayed this way for the entire time that i was on lortab. major drowsiness. every time a took the pills, it made me extremely sleepy. this made me unable to drive, do heavy activies, or even hold a conversation. also, if i taken the pill when i have had nothing to eat for a while, it seem to make me sick for a short period of time, roughly  mintues up to a hour and a half. i never became dizzy or anything else. the pill did wonders for the pain. when i took them i recieved results within -mins. they also lasted a moderate amount of time to deal with the pain as well. they do become somewhat ""addicting"". so i tried to take  - mg of ibuprofen to compensate for the lortab. however, when your in a lot of pain, ibuprofen just doesnt to seem to deliever the results that lortab could provide."
1,mum is notably brighter and more responsive whilst taking aricept.  on mornings when tablets are forgotten (or inadvertantly dropped) she is much less alert and therefore alot more challenging to care for (less likely to be able to perform tasks she usually can perform herself) no side affects where apparent - however due to communication difficulties this is hard to assess onset of signs approx  years ago.  diagnosed approx  years ago and taking aricept for approx  years.  dose has been gradually increased and at times medication has been stopped because we've been unsure it's still helping - but we notice the difference without them
0,"lowered cholesterol i experienced severe pain in my muscles and joints. i was very active when i started the medication and shortly after taking the lipitor, it became difficult to get out of bed and my activity level significantly lowered because of the pain.  after i stopped taking the lipitor, most of the pain stopped.  the muscle pain is gone, but some of the joint pain has continued. the doctor perscribed the lipitor for my high cholesterol.  i questioned it because though my overall chloesterol was high, my hdl was high and my triglycerides were very low.  lipitor lowered both ldl and hdl."

0,none severe dizziness and nausea i went to dr because it looked like a wound on my leg from a scrap was getting infected.  he prescribed levaquin for  days.  i only took one tablet and within  hours i felt very lightheaded and nauseaus.  i actually had to lay down and have someone call the doctor for me.  they told me to quit taking it and put me on cefadroxil (generic for duricef) instead.  i tolerated that fine.  levaquin is a very expensive antibiotic and now i'm stuck with the cost of that.  they should just give it out in - tablet doses first to see if you can tolerate it before you get a full  day supply.

0,hardly any- it was much less effective than paracetamol against the pain. i still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. i hoped taking voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective. none  mg voltaren & .g ibuprofen a day during periods of extreme pain
1,this  slows the sugar going into my system so that my body can use most of my own insulin to process the sugar.  it is to be taken along with the metformin. it has helped control my blood sugar very well. it can sometimes cause nausea. at the start of treatment it was bad but now it only happens if i miss a dose then the next one will cause nausea.  the first couple of months i saw a very slight drop in weight but i am not sure if the byetta caused this. i take a shot before my first meal and last meal each day.  it is a very easy shot to give to myself but it is easy to forget if i eat out or if i am traveling.

1,"in taking finasteride .mg per day for six months i noticed an increase in hair growth of new hairs and existing ones. most of the increased hair growth was in the crown region of the head. there was an increase  of hair growth of the front hair line, but it was not substantial. my hair also grew at a faster rate than normal. the side effects of taking finasteride .mg per day for six month period were feeling dehydrated, having dry mouth. especially in the morning. i also experienced a lower libido than normal. i also experienced a lower level of energy throught the day. the side effects were not extreme and did go away after discontinuing the treatment. the treatment details were the oral intake of finasteride. i obtained it in the mg form known as proscar. i would cut the tablet in half to get a .mg dosage. i took .mg of finasteride every day at night before i went to sleep. if i missed a dosage i waited for the next day to take the next dosage. taking the whole mg dosage per day in my opinion would be to high a dosage. the side effects would increase."

0,"the benefit is that it cleared up the giardia infection i had. the side effects were scary, and i was not prepared for them. the second day i was on it i became very dizzy, nauseous, shaky, lightheaded and sweaty. it happened so quickly that i got scared and had to leave work. the next day i was still shaky and dizzy, but not as bad as the day before. i remained nauseous, shaky, and dizzy for the remainder of the treatment. doctors and pharmacists should warn patients of these possible side effects so they can prepare for them if necessary. also, let your work know you are on this so they expect a change in you during your treatment. take with food because the taste is awful.  mg, three times a day for seven days."
1,"this treatment helped with my rheumatoid arthritis as i had decided not to take any stronger drugs anymore.  i attribute my being able to function on just one a day to my taking of many supplements, i.e. fish oils, msm, vit c, e and so forth.  i also do tai chi and try to stay as active as i can.  so far, so good!! i have had no side effects; i'm lucky that way. i started off with one  mg tablet x a day and am now down to  a day."
1,drug was prescribed for off label use to treat recurrent infections by physician whose protocol addresses high viral load in limbic system (chicken pox) and gi tract (mmr vaccine remnants).  it seemed to work - could be that other environmental variables were removed simultaneously but i can't think of variables that were exactly concurrent with taking of this drug.  it stopped  week recurrent symptoms of cold/flu-like exhaustion. none that i was aware of see above - off label use for recurrent cold infections.
1,much greater ability to breathe. i didn't observe any significant side effects aside from a little bit of dry mouth which is alleviated by drinking some water. i took this for maintenance to prevent asthma exacerbations. i used it every morning by exhaling first then inhaling the medication from the disc. it worked well when i used it.

1,"ear pain decreased on the third day.  ear pain was gone by the day . both infections went away on the th day.  this drug worked as expected and the results were remarkable. i did not experience any adverse side effects from the zithromax.  i was experiencing fatigue, nausia, sleeping problems and other typical flu or cold symptoms, but i think that was mostly due to the infections not the zithromax. i took the zithromax for  days, once a day with two dosages on the first day just as prescribed.  i rested for the first three days and experienced a great improvment in my condition."
1,"i can not shut my mind down to go to sleep.  i will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot ""shut down."" i originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  my doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  i take / to / of a trazadone each night. i vary the dosage, depending on how ""excitable"" i feel that day. it takes roughly  minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  if i don't go directly to bed after taking it, if i stay up watching tv or reading, when i start to feel the effects i give in and go to bed immediately.  i have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time i accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  i had to go back to bed!  i love the drug and since i tend to be high strung anyway, i am sure that i am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone. i have had none of the side effects listed except for the ""may cause drowziness"" which is the whole reason i am taking trazadone. i take / to / of a tablet each night about  to  minutes before going to bed."
1,"the immediate benefits were the relaxing, pain free life i am now experiencing. i am not sure how long it will last, but i will take the relief for now. i have suffered with terrible back pain for going on  years, and until i was prescribed valium and norco combination, i was still in excruciating pain. the combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. when i awake, i am hurting, but within  minutes of taking meds, i am my old,  year old self again. i have experienced no side effects other than feeling high, a little off-balance, and sleepy. i actually take the valium at work and have had no problems whatsoever, i am very happy with my doctors prescribed meds, and hope valium continues to work for me in the same manner it has so far. i would highly recommend this combo for anyone having back pain or anxiety. as i live and work a very hectic job, the valium effects are a plus to keep me on an even keel, allowing me to do my work with a more mellow attitude."
1,"for over a period of several years my blood pressure has gone down and has stayed down. follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked. the doctor has recommended that i stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective. the side effects of diovan were so minimal i cannot detect them; however, i cannot take the diovan hct because it messes up my eletrolytes and i get leg and foot cramps. i try to follow dosage instructions which recommends that this pill be taken at night before going to bed, if possible. the treatment with diovan is very simple. one pill at night before going to bed.the reason for that is most people's blood pressure increases at night and many people die in their sleep at night because of high blood pressure. the problem i have is that the pills get stuck in my throat and i have to eat something like a grape or anything really that will help the pill go down.it does not seem to keep me awake at night which is good."

1,"i have been struggling with adult acne. a dermatologist prescribes the minocycline and for the first two months, it worked great. i had perfectly clear skin and i noticed that my hair stopped falling out at it's normal rate. all the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are , wigs are definitely in order. also, i normally get tonsil stones. these also ceased. no major side effects other than it stopped working for my acne after two months so i stopped taking it.  the acne has become worse than ever.  the hair loss returned although at a somewhat diminished rate than pre-minocycline. the one remaining benefit is that the tonsil stones have not returned. it has been approximately one month since i discontinues use of the antibiotic. originally, the dermatologist prescribed that i take the antibiotic for two months. i finished the course and the acne started to come back. at that time, i went to see my gp and she said, ""if it's working, keep taking it for up to the next  mos. to a year."" against my better judgment, i took the minocycline for another two months. the efficacy obviously diminished over time and did not solve the root problem, whatever it may be."

1,"effexor was very effective at alleviating my symptoms of depression.  my mood improved dramatically, i felt happy and engaged in life again.  it also worked fairly quickly.  i began feeling the effects within the first week. the side effects i experienced while taking effexor were insomnia, rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  also, i found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk, watching tv, etc..  all in all, these were minor and as easy trade-off.  the major side effect i noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  this side effect was the reason i chose to stop taking effexor. my physician started me out on .mg/day for  week then increased the dosage to mg/day for another week and, finally, to mg/day.  after taking mg/day for about a week, i felt it was too much...my heart was always racing, i couldn't sleep, and i generally just felt ""nervous"".  my physician dropped my dosage back to mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  i absolutely feel that the effexor helped lift my depression.  however, i eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  after being on effexor for about a year, i both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  i dropped the dosage back to .mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  i don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  within a few days of the last dose, all sexual functions were back."

0,"the benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. the spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. the general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as i noticed that they did, although i suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about  to  months however. there were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after. topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. the recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but i found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."

1,"i had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  it got to the point i was taking naps for the first time since i was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  i also felt cold frequently and had put on a good  pounds in a year.  when i went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  i thought it was advancing middle age.  fortunately, my md put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  i was very low.  within two weeks, i felt energized and my mood improved.  i have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower. i had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  i have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects, but this was a good experience.  fortunately, the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment. as i said, my doctor spotted the symptoms and ordered a thyroid test.  when it came back very low, she prescribed  mg a day of levothyroxine, and i felt a little better almost immediately.  within  weeks, i felt younger, more energy, better mood and my weight gain stopped.  i have enough energy to exercize and with only a slight shift in my fairly healthy diet to less fat and more fruits and vegetables, the weight has slowly come off.  i have my thyroid checked every  months with good results so far.  between the medication and some dietary changes, my cholesterol is down from  to .  i still have about  pounds to get back to my starting weight.  unless there's a permanent cure out there, i won't mind taking this little lifesaver forever."
0,"the benefits of amoxicillin were that it did help clear the infection, it seemed to help my acne, also.  i noticed it working within about four days.  i only had to take it for a week.  it did not taste bad.  it did not make me foggy headed. the amoxicillin gave me some gastrointestinal upset.  after a few days, i had mild diarrhea.  it caused a vaginal yeast infection.  after the regimen was over, i felt more tired that usual.  i think the natural flora in my body was altered and somehow made me feel more tired.  i have taken this medication several times for different infections.  i was concerned about resistance. the amoxicillin was given in mg pill form  times daily for one week. it was inconvenient to have to take the medicine every  hours, but the physician recommended this time frame in order to keep the blood levels at a helpful level.  it meant having to wake up in the middle of the night to take it."
1,"over the course of about three to four months of daily use, lifelong allergies started to decrease and then disappear altogether. none for me, some of the possible side effects are dry nasal passages, nose bleeds, and it could keep you awake if you take it too close to bedtime, but i have not experienced any of those except for  or  nose bleeds over the course of six or seven years.  tablet once per day, each day.  it takes - weeks of daily use to get the full benefits."

1,my migraines would always leave after taking imitrex or sumatriptan and then if taken at night i could go back to sleep and sleep through the night and wake feeling just fine. i found that my blood veins would stick out all down my arms and hands during the next days after the treatment and that these veins would be very painful.  there was an ache throughout my arms and sometimes in my legs due to this sumatriptan. the optimum time for the shot is at bedtime and this is when i would take the shot and immediately lie down. my heart would race just after taking the shot and i would feel pain shooting through my body. but i have always found that the headace left except if i had the shots too close together in that this seemed to stir up the headache for some reason.
0,"this drug did have benefits in that it stabilized my mood somewhat. i still suffer from severe bouts of depression- mostly caused by the side effects of the drug. the side effects are sever for me and include:  rapid weight gain which is next to impossible to loose. very high cholesterol which requires more medication (mg lipitor per day)debilitation sexual side effects: impotence and inability to reach orgasm.  profuse sweating, indigestion, lethargy.  i am now severely addicted to this medication with no way to get off it. any attempt to stop taking the medication leads to severe physical and emotional pain. i agree that this medication has some positive effects but the negative side-effect far outweigh the good.  its been prescribed over and over to me by lazy doctors not willing to help me find the right medication for my condition. any attempt to discontinue the medication has led to severe and acute withdrawal symptoms."

1,"lamictal stopped my seizures as well as epilim, but it gave me a considerate amount of energy.  some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  my depression went away with lamictal.  even when i had an appetite i still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since epilim gave me terrible cravings. i experienced hair loss at times.  i wouldn't have an appetite and throw up if i had something to eat. i get terrible mood swings.  in the beginning i would suffer from sleeplessness.  my body would be tired, but my brain wouldn't stop working.  don't know how to explain it.  i've had a little rash, but nothing serious.  i've been an athlete my whole life, so training and staying in shape is a big thing for me, but since i've been on lamictal i've gained a considerate amount of weight and not being able to lose it.  i've carried on training, but my weight just stands still, after all my weight gain.  i've managed to lose kg's in  years and that was an amazing achievement for me.  my weight has made me terribly depressed, since my body isn't accustomed to it.

i went back to my neurologist, but after driving km's and paying r, he told me that i'm talking nonsense, because lamictal has never been said to make a patient pick up weight.  there's a first time for everything you know. 

i just don't know what to do, because i just can't carry on like this.  it has affected my cycling, my running, my swimming, but he clearly doesn't give a damn. i was on epilim for a few months, but went over to epitec (lamictal) because epilim made me very tired and depressed.  apparently epitec was the tablet with the least side-effects."

i went into a severe depression in which i was either very angry, very sad or just felt numb. i cycled between those feelings. nothing brought me pleasure, the things that used to love to do like dancing or  going out with friends, did nothing for me.  i didn't care to do them. i thought i was going crazy. i was like this for about  months before i started feeling a little better and maybe about - months before i felt like myself again.  

i still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  i consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.  if you don't have someone you see on a daily basis that can point out those changes i would highly recommend the latter.  i didn't realize that i had fallen into a depression until months into it."

1,"the benefits were immediate relief from a ""racing heart"" or tachycardia caused by anxiety. i use this medicine prophylactically and found that it is very effective in controlling my heart rate and keeping it within a normal range. the only time it does not work is if i have a full-blown panic attack. at that point, other types of medications are used in addition to the atenolol. the side effects were mild but it did slightly lower my ability to determine if i was having an insulin reaction (hypoglycemia). however, once i adjusted to the medication, it was not a problem. treatment was started immediately after an initial and severe case of tachycardia. an echocardiogram ruled out any heart defect and i was started on  mg once per day. i stayed on this dose for about  years and was able to drop down to . mg per day for nearly a year. however, my symptoms returned to their original severity and i began taking my starting dose again. a few years later, i was prescribed  mg twice per day due to an increase from original symptoms. this is the dose i currently take and it is an effective and very affordable medication."

0,"the treatment cleared up papules and pustules (not completely, but significantly) and decreased redness in the face. yeast infections, stomach upset, fatigue. strangely enough, it was only after coming off of antibiotics that i developed deep cystic acne. before i had many small papules/pustules, but they were never very deep. after the antibiotics, the number i would have on my face at one time decreased, but i developed cysts deep under the surface of the skin that would sit there for weeks (never happened before). eventually stopped taking oracea because of the yeast infections. the long-term use of this and other antibiotics seems to have affected my immune system negatively."

it was disturbing and very upsetting for us a parents. we started doing research the next day and little info on the drug except for druglib.com and the official side effect page. we found drastic mood changes buried in the side effects information and discontinued use.

1,"the spironolactone has really helped my acne, especially the huge flare ups i'd have monthly with my period.  i do still occasionally have break outs, but they are usually less severe, shorter lasting, and confined to my face. the main side effect i've had is irregular periods.  first it was annoying, not knowing when my period when come.  then as my period became less frequent, it was actually kind of nice.  however, now i feel like about  or  days into my cycle i start to bloat like normal, but don;t start or get relief for about another thirty or so days.  so, now i kinda feel like it's bloating or acne to choose from. i take two  mg spironolactone tablets each morning along with  mg od doxycycline."
1,"amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines. mild drowsiness, sometimes mild nausea. i have very severe migraine disease and have tried many different treatments.  none are effective % of the time.  in my experience, amerge is the most effective for mild and moderate migraines (nothing seems to work for severe attacks). i prefer amerge because the beneficial effects seem to last longer than many of the other anti-migraine meds (often - hrs.). also, side effects seem to be negligible(no palpitations and dizziness like with imitrex). the downside is that amerge takes longer to work (- hrs) than the other triptans. but because of the better safety profile and the longer duration of effectiveness, for me amerge is a top choice for migraines."

0,there was a small reduction in my hot flashes but the side effect was bothering me too much to stay on the patch longer to see if it would have totally eliminated them over time. i developed gas pains in my abdomen where the patch was. i was very bloated and uncomfortable.  i think i gained a couple of pounds too and i had only been using it for a week. the doctor thought i should try the patch because it would bypass my liver. i have been taking pills for eight years and didn't really have any side effects - so i returned to my original treatment of estradiol and provera.

0,"facial swelling reduced dramatically over  days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  i could have just taken benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), i would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  the drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  i told the physician i reacted strongly to drugs.  since then i've learned that some physicians are quite blas� about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about ""first do no wrong"" is no longer important. constant :    pulse pounding throughout body, flushed face, odd-looking eyes (dilated), high blood pressure ( systolic range -; ), fatigue, severe insomnia, nervousness, inability to concentrate, mild vertigo (spill, drop, lurch, and fall).

1,"i am able to stay awake while driving.  i am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  my concentration is clearer.  it's not habit-forming because i could live without it.  it's just that i can not function without it.  i can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  my narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that i do not dream at night at all.  with the provigil, along with my other medications, i am able to balance day and night and not feel like i'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  also, i don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming. during the first week, my heart rate increased as i increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  i believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well, but those are gone now too. i take my provigil every morning,  mg tablets.  i am awake for about the first  hours, then i nap for a little while.  i am up for about  hours, and nap again.  then, i'm up for the evening, go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a regular hour feeling rested now."

1,"no more anxiety weight gain, sleepiness at first i was not given the proper dosage and it took about six months to get the right dose. one my body became accustomed to that dosage it was purely smooth sailing from there. the mg paxil dose completely stopped my symptoms. i have been on this drug free of problems for over  yrs"
1,"this treatment was easy and highly effective. adderall increased my overall energy levels, making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. it increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. the most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses. if taken too late in the day, it can interfere with sleep. it must be carefully controlled as it is addictive. the main side effect i have experienced though was pathological skin picking. i mainly pick at my legs, but the picking sometimes leaves small scars. it also decreases appetite, which means patients must learn new ways to remember to eat or to identify the need to eat. it can also increase blood pressure slightly. adderall was taken once in the morning every day. this medication was combined with cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. within the last year, neurofeedback (biofeedback to control brainwave patterns) was added. this treatment has been very effective, and will be continued as long as it is needed."
1,"it greatly reduced the loss of hair in shower/on pillow in the morning.  there has been no sign of balding on top of head, and no progression on the temples. there were no noticeable side effects. i take it once a day in the morning and will continue taking it indefinitely."
0,i saw absolute no change in my rosacea so can claim no benefits. i had no treatment side effects. i have rosacea on one side of my face and my physician prescribed metrogel in .%.  i rubbed the cream on the rosacea twice a day after washing my face.  after six months i saw neither improvement nor complications/side effects.
0,"the drug was prescribed for pain, and it worked to dull post op pain. the drug made me terribly constipated, which in my opinion, negated the value of the drug. the strain to eliminate was very painful considering the recent surgery. after  day of oxycontin and the ensuing constipation, i switched to  mg of ibuprofen. while not as effective for the pain, the constipation was alleviated. overall, the ibuprofen was better for me."
1,"tretinoin, used in conjunction with the obagi regimen, greatly reduced facial hyperpigmention which was due to hormones and sun damage. severe redness, burning and peeling occurred in the first - months of use, but gradually dissipated. tretinoin (pea size) was blended on the back of the hand with an equal amount of blender (# step in the obagi system).  the mixture was then applied to the face, neck and chest avoiding the eyes and lips. the residual cream remaining on the hand was spread on the back of the hands to reduce ""age spots"".  no noticeable side effects were evident on the hands, but the procedure was effective.  care was taken not to expose the treated areas to sunlight."

0,"eliminated or reduced symptoms of anxiety - eliminated heart palpitations and shortness of breath. provided a general feeling of calm. the worst, and the reason for d/c'ing, side effect was hot flashes and night sweats that awakened me and interfered with my working.
secondly, i felt drowsy during the day even on this low ( mg day) dose. i tried taking at night and the trialed taking it in the am and experienced no difference in the side effects. 
both side effects are completely gone now that i have stopped taking it. i believe i have already done so."
1,the treatment completely eliminated all annoying menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and anxiety.  i no longer wake up at night with these symptoms and can sleep soundly through the night once again. there were no negative side effects whatsoever. convenient topical gel is applied once daily.  the only con is that it took  weeks before it was fully effective.

1,"the numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. i was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well. initally when i started taking effoxor it upset my stomach. i was taking in the morning after breakfast so the dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  i have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation. i started off taking mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to mg for two weeks.  after visiting the dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to mg and eventually i increased it to mg.  this is currently the dosage i am taking."

0,not much improvement in hormonal acne. dry mouth and lips i started taking spironolactone for hormonal acne about two months ago along with tazorac and a sulfur face wash. my acne remains the same with only a small change. i still have cysts but but not as many (reduced by %).
1,"extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (i used hydrocodone apap and/or percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.) it is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. even though i am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  in addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  first, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. the other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  i had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if i waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after i was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  several specialists i saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  i withdrew from it completely  times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after i stopped using it.  although i have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, i think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.) i took duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective."
1,"the main benefit is the ability of the drug to reduce, even eliminate the panic attacks. the general mood is positively improved. many listes un the literature, but in my case the worst are intermenstrual bleeding, back pain, laziness, abscense of sexual desire. i just take one  mg pill at night. medical check-up once a year including lab tests."
1,"treatment benefits included a correction of my t, but only a mild improvement in my emotional status. i am still irritable and mildly depressed. weight gain of # in  months, continuation of my irritability and mild depression. treatment involved radiation treatment to shrink my thyroid to correct my hyperthyroidism, followed by rx with synthroid to treat the hypothyroidism."
1,"the benefits of taking effexor are wonderful. my mood has been so much better. i can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. i have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems. the side effects are mild, but excessive sweating is one of them. i seem to sweat a good bit more than i normally did as well as sweat more than other people that i notice. also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. constipation can also be a side effect. the details in the treatment are just as i described shortly above. i went to the doctor, they prescribed it and i take it. don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details."
0,"none i had little motivation, i felt like i was in a daze, my memory was worse i have recurrent major depression. this medication was prescribed to deal with a severe episode. when i stopped taking the medication after at least a year, my memory rapidly improved and i felt more alive.  i had a very bad experience with this drug."

0,the drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  the migraines were usually sseveral days long. i experienced slightly more gagging while dry heaving and nausea changed to sickening feeling and more stomach churning. took imitrex for a  month period and still had no noticeable results.  the tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  i ended up trying aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.
0,"the benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. the spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. the general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as i noticed that they did, although i suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about  to  months however. there were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after. topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. the recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but i found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."
0,"most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  the liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie,  mins instead of . the benefit was there if i was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep. twitching nerves for several days afterward.  difficulty sleeping. taking a pill to get to sleep."

decrease in skin lustre and elasticity lost interest in sex rapidly, if i was ever aroused (very rare) i couldn't achieve an orgasm, every part of my body seemed to dry out and subsequently age a bit and in the case of my eyes this drying and ageing process was pretty severe. doctors were baffled as to why i'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age, said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (i was - at the time). now looking back i realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms i was experiencing at the time, many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (i now use the copper iud), i believe they may well have been linked yasmin. yasmin is one scary pill- i came off it worried that i was prematurely going through the menopause and that i would never be able to enjoy painless, bloodless, pleasurable sex again."
1,"truly allows me to function.  i work in a mentally demanding and stressful job.  without this medication, i would not be able to work, let alone do much of anything else. yes, there are side effects.  constipation is an issue that requires trying different means to address.  tradition treatments didn't help, but odd ones that i stumbled on have - like eating raw brazil nuts; now it's home-made chex mix.  nutrisystems food (with high fiber and fillers) really works.

there is a mild, physical addiction property.  over the ten years that i have used this medication, i have slowly reduced by dosage from  mg down to  daily.  there was nauseousness and sweating, but i got through it.

when people say that prescription medicine isn't safe, i can only reply that my choices are either laying in bed because the pain is to great, or taking the medication and being able to function.  i am still limited in my physical activity, but i'm working and not constantly focused on the pain. i take the oxycontin three times a day - morning, lunch and dinner.  it is recommended to take on a full stomach, though i've never noticed an issue when i haven't.  if i take my regular dose one to two hours after it's due, my back pain is very severe, so i know it's working."
1,after - weeks complete abatement of panic attack symptoms.  after one year tried to stop taking them but within  weeks symptoms were back.  continued for two more years and stopped taking them.  have not had any symptoms for @ years now hyperactivity for up to  hrs after taking. started at  mg then increased every - days up to  mg.  hyperactivity decreased with longer treatment
1,"fiorinal almost always gets rid of my migraine headaches. occasional drowsiness, though this is preferred as i usually need to lie down in a dark place when i have a migraine. i'd typically take one fiorinal capsule at the onset of a migraine headache, with water and sometimes salted crackers. (if i didn't catch it at the onset, the capsule generally had no effect).  i would then lie down in a quiet, dark room.  the pill would typically reduce the headache within - minutes.  occasionally i would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  regardless, it has worked well to reduce headache pain."

0,"the st week  felt great.  all the racing thoughts were gone.  mind was kinda empty and quiet.  i could concentrate.  i was able to think of a task that needed done and complete it.  then move on to the next task.  was only able to work on  thing at a time instead of going from one thing to the next without finishing anything. could listen to the person talking to me without starting to day dream and lose the conversation. was very happy with it. st  days had nothing in my head.  no thoughts at all.  didn't talk because there was nothing to say.  i could understand people talking to me, but didn't have responses.  kinda groggy. took a nap on the st day, which is something i never do.  in my third week, feel like its stopped working.  minds not racing like before, but feels like all my thoughts are blurry. feel very blah, not motivated at all. could sit all day and do nothing.  before meds i ran around all day from one thing to the next and not finish anything.  i could be in the middle of folding laundry, then walk away to do the dishes.  i couldn't take my kids with me to the grocery store because their talking would distract me and i would forget things.  taking a list wouldn't help because i couldn't write lists.  now, i don't even want to do the laundry.  i don't want to do anything.  i wondering if changing the dose will help. started out on ml.  which i thought was kinda high because i only weigh .  was told to go to ml after only  days.  i did that and could not sleep at all!  was awake for at least  hours.  so the doc had me go back down to ml.  which isn't working now."
1,bladder spasms and urge incontinence were banished immediately. urinary frequency continued but is becoming less as i am able to retrain my bladder to hold more urine. i was particularly pleased not to suffer from constipation or dry mouth which are listed as common side effects. none vesicare mg tablet taken once daily in the morning.
1,patient was able to focus more readily on tasks at hand. there was an increase in intensity/focus which was noticable upon taking the medication. dry mouth patient was to take one dose of concerta per day - earlier in the morning due to the time release effect. it was obvious while taking the medication that it was time release as each layer was released.

1,allowed me to sleep soundly without feeling groggy in the morning. i didn't have any side effects if i was allowed enough sleep.  if i did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and i would feel as if i had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  i would say at least - hours of sleep is needed. take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  this prescription was issued for six months and i am currently still taking it.  it does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when i can sleep without it and do not crave it.
1,"in a very short period of time, there was a mental clarity that i had never experienced. i felt a calm and order to my life and work. i was truly able to focus on important things that i needed to do and did so efficiently, which was something i was never able to do. menopause exacerbated the extreme mental fuzziness that i had already been experiencing with  children and a more than full time job. this drug has truly changed my life for the better! i did not experience any side effects that were negative. i could hear better and think in a focused way within a short amount of time (- minutes after taking the drug) i take a  mg. pill shortly after waking and within an hour, the fog that i chronically have had all of my life just lifts!"
1,"the xanax helped slow things down and make everything less stressful. helped me to stay on a calm even level. unfortuntely it is extremely addictive and you can find yourself craving it, and everything can become a problem if i didnt have any.  dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if i didnt have it.  had to stop taking it as soon as i noticed my behavior. i want to say it was  mg. doses taken up to  times a day.  it was somewhat up to me when i needed to take it.  mostly for anxiety attacks."
1,"within  minutes the drug began to calm down the situation and i was able to function normally again. my racing heart rate was decreased, the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. i was able to eat again, and go about my daily routine. the only real side effect was that depending on the severity of the attack and the amount i took, as sometimes i cut the pill in half, or if the case was extremely severe, i could take up to  mg. was that i got very sleepy. in a lower dose that was not the case but in the higher dosage it did occur. the treatment details were to take only as needed and it could be taken up to x per day, but usually one pill did the trick. i didn't have a set protocol for taking the medication because the attacks were so random, they might not occur for months at a time, or they could happen two days in a row. so, i was told to take it only as needed. i still have a number of pills left from my rx of  last year."
1,"i had a bad uti with awful pain on myside i couldnt walk..i was prescribed this and have never taken it so i was a little nervous. the side affect i had was headache,diarriah after the rd day,and a i got my period (im not regular) really bad to where i had to goto hospital...i dont know if that was related to the medication. it treated my uti i was better in a week but because of my heavy period i quit taking it after the th day..its been months and have not had any reoccurance of the uti"
1,"within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! i went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than i had since i was in my teens. i began to lose some of the weight i had gained from being depressed. i was in a wonderful mood and i had so much more energy than i had in years. my overall experience with prozac has been perfect! i have had no known side effects to this date. i do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and i have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected. i started on  mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well i went up to  mgs. this caused some insomnia and nervousness so my dr. lowered it to  mgs. a day. there are still times i get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. i am looking at being on prozac as long as my body toleates it, due to once being taken off i went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again."
0,"there were no benefits.  it did not solve the organic issues and created new problems. firstly, this medication made me drowsy, and i often took involuntary naps mid-afternoon. secondly, i had carbohydrate cravings, and felt hungry all the time. lastly, after a couple of weeks i became weepy, irrational and anxious.  i can't imagine how magnified these symptoms would have been on a higher dose. i began taking celexa after lexapro made me sleepy and hungry.  the lexapro did indeed calm my anxieties.  it was thought that an isomer of lexapro might be better tolerated.  this was not the case, and now i am off all medications for a short period to re-evaluate my baseline needs."
1,"citalopram turned me into myself again. i didn't really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. i have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. i wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. i feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. i have also experienced some weight loss while on citalopram, probably because i feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! additionally i've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly. in the first few weeks i felt a little shaky and experienced dry mouth. this was perscribed by my gynocologist and i plan to take it for the next year, then reasses my need."

1,"i was diagnosed with a mild case of fibromyalgia, i was not able to get a good night's sleep for years because of the symptons of fibromyalgia, muscle pain and tingling in my back and arms, and i was prescribed this drug to help me sleep at night. no side effects were experienced by me, just a good night's sleep. before i started taking the pills i tossed and turned every night due to my symptoms and got very little rest, but the elavil helped me sleep thru the night and i woke up very rested and with very little pain. i took it for several years and stopped last year after i gradually cut back on my dosage, exercise and yoga have helped me manage my symptoms so i no longer needed help to sleep at night."
1,"the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit. extreme dryness, redness, flaking, chapped lips, and occasional lower back pain.  i used aquaphor twice a day all over my face and lips.  this is the only way i could look ""normal"" because my face looked like it was literally peeling off. i was prescribed mg of sotret once a day for  months in addition to being on orthotricylcen lo birth control pills as part of the pregnancy prevention program agreement.  i was to undergo a monthly blood test and see my dermatologist to assess how my body was tolerating the drug and whether i was improving or not."
0,"the drug helped relieve the anxiety from worrying about the sudden return of the rapid heartbeat episode that happened at work without warning and under no stress. i was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping. i noticed that after taking the drug for several days i became very irritable and short tempered.  the side effects stopped when i stopped taking the drug.  i have never taken it since. i stopped taking the drug after recalling a collegue of mine taking the drug after the death of her mother.  her mood and personality changed to anger and paranoia as she was taking it for a long time. after suffering an exreme onset of a rapid heartbeat at work (it started while i was laughing, believe it or not) i saw a cardiologist who determined that there was nothing physically wrong with me, however i started having problems relaxing and sleeping at night for fear the condition would suddenly return without warning while alone or sleeping (i thought it might lead to a heartattack!).  the doctor gave me a prescription for zanax which helped, but caused the undesireable side effect.  the condition never occured again."

1,"good lifting of depressive feelings, reduction in chronic back pain associated with endometriosis and fibromyalgia dry mouth and shaky hands . shakiness subsided in - days initially given nortriptyline for depression.  it helped and after months of therapy the decision was made to discontinue.   i noticed an increase in low back pain that i had in the sacral area associated with endometriosis and all over body aches associated with fibromyalgia.

i read that nortriptyline at that time was being experimentally used for neurological pain so i asked to go back on to see if it helped and it did.
although i eventually had to have a hysterectomy due to the severity of the endometriosis i still had/have to deal with chronic pain of fibromyalgia.  i cannot tolerate the pain without the nortriptyline mg at bedtime.

i would highly recommend a trial of this if you have any chronic pain issues at all.  although other pain meds may have to be taken occasionally due to severity changes the nortriptyline for me really cuts that down."

0,"at first it helped. i did not realize at first that they were side effects. i thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. then i began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue, anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with copd. then i started to have choking fits. they were becoming so serious that i feared choking to death. i suspected advair, so i tried not taking it and then taking it again. the cause was identified and i stopped taking advair. the choking fits ceased. the fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). the chronic bronchitis improved dramatically. i was diagnosed with copd about  years ago. i started taking advair about eight years ago. during the course of treatment i tried spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. at one time i was taking singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. so i quit that. throughout the entire period i have used duoneb and zyrtec. i think i was originally put on / advair. that was increased, some years back, to /, and about two years ago reduced back to /. at all times i used the advair twice a day.

my pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when i developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when i had to stop using advair. i went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the advair. i still take duoneb and zyrtec. i stopped taking the advair one year ago. i am just now recovering from the adrenal problem. my copd has not worsened."

1,"the benefits i received from treatment with this unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, tsh, t etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. another benefit from unithroid drug was that the goiter which i had developed prior to unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again. my freaking hair has fallen out to the point that i am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. my hair has been falling out since i began treatment with unithroid and continues to shed today. my hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair i had is now thin, and breaks easily. from the hundreds of complaints i keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that i am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. other side effects are sometimes depending on what i eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing. not sure theres much to describe. i had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. my previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with hashimotos disease. thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something i now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. per my initial thyroid doctor, hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the unithroid drug dosage i initially received . mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. dosage was increased to  mcg. then to  mcg. then increased to  mcg. at some point, during these adjustments i went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the t drug called cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and i was taken off of this drug. the last unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment i was given was for  mcg. xday  days wk with / dosage to be taken on sundays. medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. last year, my body became toxic to the unithroid as i hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. was restarted at a low dose of  mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. this dosage was gradually increased i am now being treated with a unithroid dosage of  mcg. for whatever reason, this survey is being taken, it would be a blessing to myself and so many others if for once someone would develop a natural alternative to drugs like unithroid, synthroid etc. other than the natural alternatives on the market that are derived from pigs glands considering more people than not today do not intake pork products of any kind."

0,"some reduction in lung inflammation severe mood swings, depression, frequent lung infections i took singulair for years before i realized that it was not really doing much and i strongly suspect that it contributed to my severe depression and mood swings.  i have always had severe asthma and allergies and was hospitalized many times as a youngster.  i did have allergy shots which i truly think helped with my allergies.  when i got older, and inhaled cortisteroids were invented i started taking them, along with singulair.  i was told that it was the ""most benign medication that i was on"" so i never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  i suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  when i was , i started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  i continued the singulair without any thoughts.  however, after my third child, we were broke and i was trying to cut some medications down to save money and i stopped the singulair for a while.  i did notice that my asthma got worse so i figured oh well, have to start the singulair again, that's when i started having the severe mood swings again.  i started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.  in my heart of hearts, i truly believe that more attention should be given to this drug, and it's affects on the brain.  i am no longer taking it and i am having much better luck with zyrtec."

1,"elidel reduced my dry skin by about -%. it increased exfoliation, which is very slowed down in hypothyroid-related dry skin, got rid of many of the blocked pores due to poor exfoliation, and stopped the vast majority of the flaking, burning, and redness i had suffered from before i used it. the first week i used elidel i got some flu-like symptoms, as warned on the package insert. it stands to reason that elidel would make one very sun-sensitive, as it shuts down the skin's immune system; i didn't have a problem with this, as i always wore sunscreen, but it made me nervous. as i understand it, elidel isn't formulated to help the skin help itself; instead it just shuts off the skin's erroneous response. for some skin conditions, this is sufficient, but it wasn't for me. after washing my face with gentle cleanser, i applied a small amount of elidel to my entire face, before following up with a moisturizer (or two), then sunscreen."

1,"significantly reduced anxiety without feeling 'damped down' or 'numbed'. feel normal, but with reduced anxiety. compared to short-halflife anti-anxiety medications, no feeling of emotional dependency on a once-daily ongoing regimen. generally rarely experience side effects. taken on an empty stomach, mild transient nausea, but this is quickly addressed with any light snack. discontinuation syndrome (when i have run out of the medication, or once when discontinued for  days due to elective surgery) is quite unpleasant. prescribed to act synergistically with stimulants prescribed for adhd: the stimulants tend to increase anxiety, which also increases the necessary therapeutic dose for the stimulants, so this very low dose of the multiple reuptake inhibitor effectively reduces the dosage needed of the stimulant for therapeutic effect. this combination enabled me to reduce my stimulant dosage by % and also decreased my anxiety very substantially--the effect was almost immediately remarked on by my partner as well as in my own subjective opinion."

1,the benefits are amazing.  i felt dizzy and like i was going to faint before i took the drug.  these symptoms went away and have stayed away for going on  years.  i also have seen that it helps with blood pressure and pulse rate. i have never experienced any adverse side affects. i simply take one tiny tablet each morning.

(it is july)  i am unable to excercise for fear of rupturing a tendon.  my left achilles feels stiff andi am worried it is permanantly damaged.  i have never had tendonitis, but i am shocked that i could potentially be forever burdened with it.  my elbows, ankles, knees, hips and thighs, shoulders, neck ..all  of it in extreme pain.  last night began the horrific nightmares. i went to urgent care because i was having severe kidney pain and i found blood in my urine.  the dr. too found blood and protien and suggested this drug.   i mentioned that i rarely take even and aspirin and am prone to side effects.  i also mentioned that a week earlier i had bloodwork done and it showed an inflamed liver.  i waited for the office to call me with the results which they never did.  finally i called and they said they had lost my number, but yes indeed i did have a uti.  ( days later). i mentioned that i was having severe side effects and before i said what they were, they said, ""it doesn't sound related to the drug"".  it was an apprubt brush off.  will these sypmtoms ever go away?  what is the time frame?"
0,"the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. i thought that i had been cured of the skin rash. it cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash. it turns out it did not cure it at all but possibly hurt my face.  it also may have made the condition spread to other areas of my face because in time i had other areas of my face where the rash was.  the cream was only a temporary relief to a deeper situation. if one is looking for fast relief it will help but it covers up an initial problem that needs to be addressed. i saw a few dermatologists and each one told me to use it twice daily. i was even given different forms. one a cream and the other a foam.  i was also informed to use them for two weeks and then stop. i did, and when i stopped my rash slowly started coming back."
1,"by using this treatment a minimum of every other day, i noted that the lines around the eyes (crows feet)were diminished greatly. also, the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. i have, at times, gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time, particularly during the summmer when the florida sun is at its most intense. initially, the skin has to get used to the treatment.  i experienced redness and moderate flaking in the first  weeks (at different intervals). however, the skin eventually becomes tolerant of the product.  there is still the periodic sloughing of dead skin cells; but that's okay because you'll have a fresh, healthy glow afterwards. retin a is a simple topical application to use.  i use it sparingly, minimum every other day, on my face and neck. i plan to continue using this product as part of my anti-aging regimine."

1,"i have/had an extremely easy to irritate stomach, over-sensitive to acid and food consumption. i spent most days feeling unbelievably bloated, even after only a few bites of food, sometimes. protonix was prescribed to me in combination with domperidone to reduce bloating, belching, and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach. none, really, that i can specifically blame on this drug. i had actually reacted fairly badly to other, similar drugs. the famous ""purple pill"" nexium had actually given me a brutal headache, sore-throat, and even a racing heart-beat at times. i was somewhat anxious about taking another very similar medication, but pantoprazole did not bother me at all (i have since read that pantoprazole is one of the acid-reducers least likely to cause side-effects). treatment has been ongoing for several months and is set to continue. while still not quite ""normal"", i am feeling much better after several months of this therapy and will be discussing reducing my dosage and/or going off the drug completely in the next month or two."
0,"my depression was significantly alleviated.  i would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  it was like there was some ""padding"" between me and the bad feelings. there were actually no physical side effects, but i found that i said a lot of things i wouldn't normally say, and which i was embarassed about later.  prozac made me feel like everything was fine, so i didn't take things seriously enough, and didn't take care of things which really needed to be taken care of.  i feel like i wasn't a good parent during that time, because my attitude was ""eh...who cares?...everything is fine"".  

i also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. i tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  i thought i'd have to be on it for life.  however, once i managed to make it through a full week without it, i felt fine, and have never had to use it again. i have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  i asked my doctor to prescribe prozac.  for the first week i felt the same, but i slept almost / and barely ate. after that i did get a significant relief from the depression.  unfortunately, as i noted above, i don't like the way i acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things i said and did.  but at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  looking back, if i had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life i would have been a lot better off in the long run."

0,"after taking effexor for several weeks, i felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  this anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but i think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences. i don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. the more severe side effects became apparent after i began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. at that time, although i withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period, the tinnitus was quite pronounced, especially after any sudden head movements.  i often felt dizzy for no reason. i'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose, escalating to a higher one.  this was done in reverse when i decided to stop taking effexor.  in retrospect, i'm not sure how much it helped me but had i known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication, i probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative."

1,"benefits of naproxen helped with inflammation in the neck. having a herniated disc the size of a plum impinged on a nerve for about a year and a half caused permanent nerve and muscle damage in the right arm. after surgery there was immediate relief however, because of the damage there are still issues with pain and inflammation. there are also still  bulging discs in the same area as the  herniated discs that were removed and replaced (i.e.) acdf surgery. at times there were stomach irritations as a result of naproxen. it caused acid reflux to be moderate to severe at times. taking with food helped and at other times it was necessary to take a medicine for the upset. treatment for inflammation in the cervical spine after acdf surgery was necessary to remove  discs that were herniated and had a nerve severely impinged. as a result of nerve impingement there is permanent nerve damage and muscle damage. almost  years after surgery still see doctor monthly for inflammation and pain. there are also  bulging discs that at this point and time have yet to cause any further surgery or pain."

0,"gabapentin worked extremely well for my leg neuropathy.a combination of zyrtec and veramyst works quite well for my allergies. requip takes care of my restless legs which at times had me getting up and having to walk to relieve the discomfort. baclofen helps with my spasticity. after taking amitriptyline i am able to go to sleep in an hour or so. as for the copaxone who knows? i have had only one flare up since starting it. the detrol was horrible. my mouth was so dry my tongue  literally stuck to the roof of my mouth making it difficult to speak. the copaxone causes lumps and itching at the injection site. when zyrtec alone didn't controll my allergies my doctor prescribed the veramyst to try. this combination seems to be working, zyrtec once a day and veramyst twice daily. the baclofen mg.is taken as needed one to four times a day. sometimes i'm not bothered with spasticity too often but when i am i take the baclofen and it works.amitriptyline tabs mg are taken before bedtime.requip tabs .mg are taken in the evening. gabapentin mg is taken - times a day depending on the severity of pain. tetracycline hcl mg is taken once a day. the copaxone mg is injected once a day. i discontinued the detrol la as i could not tolerate the extreme dry mouth."

1,"xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either i need fast relief (one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines) or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation (i.e relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives.) the only thing to be aware of with this drug is that it is very short acting so while it may be perfect for situational anxiety (e.g a speech, social event, dentist etc) its not a good idea for people with more generalised anxiety as its short acting nature may mean that people get rebound anxiety and then feel the need to dose again (can lead to dependance.) when taking as needed for particular events it works perfectly as a treatment"
1,"it lowered my blood pressure from borderline high (/) to normal (about /).  this treatment worked most of the time.  the only time it did not work as well was when i was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  during those times, even with the lisinopril, my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level. for over a year after starting the treatment i believe i had a side effect of a dry cough that was probably caused by this drug.  it was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when i temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  when the coughing was at it's worst, my blood pressure went up, nullifying the effect of the linsinopril. in spite of the irritating coughing, i continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one dr. thought it was because of acid reflux), the coughing finally subsided.  after about a year of coughing, the coughing finally subsided and now (- years later) i don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril."

1,"singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  if i forget to take it, i can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about  hours after the last dose.  i will on occasion (maybe - times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  in fact, i have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since i started taking singulair. there are no apparent side effects of singulair for me. my asthma had become so bad that when i was to be administered a test where i would be exposed to irritants to guage the severity of my asthma, i did not even get past the saline control before my breathing was adversely affected.  i would say that my experience with singulair has been superior (only surpassed  by advair, which i had to stop using due to the fact that my insurance company wouldn't cover it anymore.  that led to my change to singulair.)"
1,"the treatment benefits were really not noticable because the condition of hypothyroidism ranges from non-symptomatic to many symptoms.  at the time of diagnosis, i only had symptoms of mild fatigue which could have been the result of many other conditions there were really no overt, obvious side effects of the treatment.  levothyroxine is known to cause insomnia.  it may have been coincidence, but my sleeping habits deteriorated approximately at the same time i began therapy.  i am currently in the process of reducing my dose to see if sleep habits improve, but lab values remain at good levels as i mentioned above, my diagnosis was based almost exclusively on labratory tests.  tsh and t (thyroid hormone) were found to be too high and too low, respectively.  relatively non-descript symptoms accompanied the list of complaints at the time of diagnosis.  these symptoms improved somewhat after treatment.  it is still to be determined if side effects will be improved on reduced dosage."
1,"it completely eliminated all heartburn symptoms.  i am able to eat what i want whenever i want.  this is after nearly  years (before going on the drug) of trying to change my diet and lifestyle but no matter what i did, i could not find relief of constant, daily heartburn.  my days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. this drug finally gave me relief. no side effects. unlike another user claims, this drug does not ""teach"" your body to produce more acid.  once it's out of your system, it's out of your system, and yes the symptoms of acid reflux will likely return because this drug is not meant to cure any underlying condition, but simply to manage the painful symptoms of gerd and other problems with producing excess stomach acid.  i will probably have to take it forever, but it's worth it to me to take a medicine every day versus suffering every day with constant heartburn and acid reflux."

1,"reduced acne.  i had mild/moderate acne, and retin-a did decrease the amount of ance i had.  i liked retin-a also because it reduces wrinkles.  i am only , so i don't have many wrinkles, but used it as prevention. my skin would become too dry.  it seemed that even after months of usage, my ance would not completely disappear.  if i used more retin-a, my acne would get better for a week or two until my skin became too dry and then i would have worse acne i would apply retin-a to my face once a day at night"
1,"lyrica really helped my pinched nerves and radicuopathy in my legs. i would go to bed in terrible pain and sometimes couldn't even lie down because my lower back and legs would cause me so much discomfort. when i woke up i couldn't feel my legs and could barely walk. lyrica makes it easy and painless to sleep and in the morning i can walk and drive without worrying if my legs will go numb. after taking lyrica i developed tinnitus. i started hearing morse code, music, and running water. i was also checked for ear problems and schizophrenia and the tests were negative. it did cause some drowsiness and made it hard to get up in the morning for the fist two or three weeks, but overall it has been a blessing. no weight gain either, although my doctor did warn me it could happen. take as recommended by your doctor."
0,"the only time i didn't want to smoke was when i was so nauseous and or throwing up after taking the medication. i seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication. nausea, vommiting, depression, vivid dreams, and nightmares.  the vommiting came on within minutes of ingestion and my physician offered no other dosage or medication to alleviate the side effects. i was to be on this course of treatment for a possible  weeks....from the onset of treatment, i experienced every one of the adverse effects and was told that after a few weeks they would subside...so was not the case in my situation...i finally gave up as my life was severely impacted by using this medication."
1,"this drug is very effective in making me sleep well, and works as a paralytic on my brain to keep me from sleep walking/talking.  it has also cut down on my migraines since i started taking it. daytime drowsiness, highly addictive, bad withdrawal symptoms which caused terrible insomnia. i took mg at night (up from an initial / mg dose) before bed as a treatment for sleep walking/talking and the inability to progress to deep sleep. this medicine worked great at first, but after  months i was no longer seeing a benefit.  the doctor took me off of it for  weeks as a drug holiday to let my brain rest, and had to put me on another med during that time because i had terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal (i have never had insomnia in my life).  i do have some short term memory problems, but overall saw a bigger benefit to feeling better and an increased quality of life to stop taking the drug."

1,"relieves a migraine  out of  times. strange tingling sensations, a 'floaty' feeling, occasional stomach ache sometimes it makes me feel really weird for awhile afterwards, but it is worth it to calm the pounding in my head. i've had migraines since kindergarten and only recently discovered imitrex. i never knew there was actually a pill that would take away a migraine. i think they cause rebound headaches, and they're ridiculously expensive, but it's more than worth it in the moment."

1,"the benefits of taking protonix  mg is that my ulcer cleared up, and i was able to resume eating what i call normal foods.  i changed and stopped eating pizza, meat balls or extremely spicy foods, but if possible i will take a tums before just to reduce any chance of problems. i don't believe i had any side effects.  i know protonix just like nexium can be an addictive medicine simply because it work so well.  some people seem to have minor side effects, but i am in great health and in good shape and i did not seem to have any side effects from using protonix. i was prescribed protonix  mg which i took daily for  days.  extended use is not recommended, and i did not surpass the  days.  i do buy extra strength tums and take it if i have any real acid or spicy foods.  the bottom line is i had a lot of pain with my ucler which came out of nowhere and after almost  weeks of pain i decided i needed to see a doctor.  soon after taking protonix my pain went away, but as with any ulcer a diet change might be in order.  similar drugs are nexium, prevacid, prilosec, etc."
0,"reduced inflammation, swelling and pain on the in-side of left knee area headache, dull pain around side of head and to the rear. numbing to one half of right arm from elbow to finger tips. did not affect thumb or digit next to, just the other three fingers. my doctor prescribed celebrex to treat an injury i sustained while playing tennis. i damaged soft tissue ligaments/muscle tissue to the in-side of the knee, which became heavily swollen, painful and inflamed.
i was prescribed this drug as i am allergic to ibuprofen based pain killers.

initially i experienced slight tingling and intermittent dull ache to areas around the side, uppersides and rear of the cranium.
it felt like pulsing which lasted about  seconds before fading away. and continued the cycle ranging from  minute to  minutes in duration at different times of the day. this occured a day into starting treatment.
this gradually faded away within a week but came back weeks after stopping treatment. eventually subsided after a month or so."
1,i was relieved of menstrual cramps within  minutes of taking the pill and during nighttime i was able to sleep peacefully without any pain.i was able to carry out my routine work there are absolutely no side effects it is advisable to take the tablet after breakfast and after dinner so that makes it twice a day but only for  days
0,i didn't feel that it was beneficial but the cough and yellow phelgm production lead me believe my bronchitis was bacterial therefore i had my doctor prescribe an antibiotic.  the one would not have been my choice for a respiratory issue. i took the first dose without food liek the direction said and about  minutes later i was vomiting. i was to take  tablets the first day and then one a day for  days.  after the fifth day my congestion/phlegm was clear so i stopped the medication.  i continued to have the irritating bronchitis wheezey cough.  so now i'm not sure the antibiotic really helped.
1,"i started to take prempro, the lowest dose, at age , because i would have freak periods - every six months.  i never really went through menopause.  no hot flashes, no night sweats.  but just a period out of the blue.  my doctor put me on  pill/day, ., ., and then i started to decrease the dose slowly to / pill per day, then / pill/day, then / pill/day.  now i take one pill/week.  i find that the prempro keeps my skin smooth and prevents incontinence, which started to happen when i tried to quit the drug entirely.
i still take it, but i do have water retention, even with this small dose. water retention, breast enlargement (not a bad thing). see benefits."
1,"the drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (zodac, zaditen) which i took before for the same condition. it did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what i expected (i took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation). i felt slightly tired after taking zyrtec. however, this was not severe and i always took it in the evening because the information leaflet did mention that the drug can have these side effects. i was also always slightly more tired in the following morning (about - hrs after taking the drug) than typically. this is a non-prescription drug and i took it because i was experiencing severe itching caused by eczema. it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. i only took it about  times when the itching was very bad, and it did alleviate it. i always took  pill a day."
0,"in order to get any effects, i had to take - times the prescribed dosage.  the medication is simply very weak.  this drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level. i did not experience any side effects on a normal or high dose.  a very high dose (only taken accidentally, because i forgot i had taken my usual dose earlier) on an empty stomach, will produce an unpleasant ""high"" feeling mentally, including spaciness and shakiness.  therefore you can't just keep taking more and more of the drug. bottom line, this drug just isn't very effective.  it's more effective, and significantly safer, than the nsaids that docs are still prescribing for fibromylagia.  but i am looking for better daily pain management."
1,"this medication was the only thing that was able to put me to sleep regularly after over  years of chronic insomnia! there were no side effects. i usually took  mg. per night.  occasionally it would have trouble falling asleep again, and then i would increase the dose to  mg. for a few days.  i would then go back to  mg. once i got back into a regular sleeping pattern.  although trazodone is a mild anti-depressant, i did not notice any difference in my mood."
1,"at first, the acne on my face just went away. it's best for when you use it only once in a while. i got my prescription for retin-a micro refilled about  months ago because it worked so well that i ran out of it! now when i get acne and i apply the cream before bed, i wake up and there's no difference. the acne's still as big and as red as before. my skin must've gotten used to it or something, because it doesn't get rid of my acne. i apply it before bed each night and the acne's still the same. it worked great at first, but now i don't use it anymore."
1,"did not take my pain away fully but it took the edge off things and helped me throught the day to do some activities i usually could not do without the drug. side effects were mild upset stomach, insomnia if taken before bed, boosted my mood,and social life. before tramadol i used  hydrocodone (vicodin) which is a narcotic pain killer ..it was was very effective with my pain but had a terrible come down ,i was very irritable and was just mad at things that with a sober mind i would not be mad at. tramadol has little come down and has a more natural ""high"" it boost your mood , with little euphria unlike narcotic pain killers. it feels as if someone just put the nicest , softest, warm blanket over you
tramadol  makes me alot more social, it boosts my mood and makes me just want to talk to people as normaly i would not want to associate with people as much.i recomend this drug to all. it is alot better for you than narcotic pain killers"
1,"it greatly reduced the effects i get from seasonal allergies including sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and an itchy upper soft palate at the back/roof of my mouth.  it takes care of most of it, but i still get some itchiness at roof of my mouth. no side effects! i take one pill in the morning, and one at night."

1,"the medication helped the patient focus on daily activities and think more clearly. it also eased the patient's nervous 'fidgeting'. the patient experienced some side-effects, including dry-mouth/increased thirst, dry skin and increased mild acne, and some mild sexual side-effects. the patient has attempted to combat all side-effects with increased water consumption. the patient was diagnosed with adhd after describing a pattern of focus, memory and affect regulation problems she had experienced consistently since early childhood. the patient was given an initial prescription for adderall xr in a  mg/day dose. the patient experienced an immediate improvement in her condition, which lasted for nearly three months. at three months, the patient described a waning of the positive effects of the medication but e reticence to increase the dosage without first pursuing other modes of treatment. 

after six months of treatment the patient, who had also begun behavioral counseling, agreed to increase her dosage to  mg/day. she has reported some increase in treatment side-effects but is generally pleased with the medication's positive effects."

1,"increased focus, attention, productivity. better able to pay attention and absorb information in class. reduced impulsivity. increased motivation, increased mood. lasts much longer than other adhd drugs with much less severe side effects. restless legs at night, insomnia, headache (sometimes pretty bad). also, make sure you take it and then start productive things, otherwise you attention will be focused on whatever you are doing when it starts to work, i.e. playing online games for hours. i took adderall once as a child, and it made me so miserable that i never wanted to take it again. concerta did nothing for me either, and as an adult, vyvanse was the first adhd drug i was put on since i was in elementary school. i've been on  mg,  mg, and  mg.  works best for me, lasting about  hours.  mg kept me from being able to fall asleep and  mg only lasted about .- hours. i am able to pay attention and absorb the information in my classes. i also found that vyvanse put me in a good mood for the day!"
0,"emotions were somewhat blunted. less moodiness. weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. extreme lethargy. i was on zoloft for about  years total. i am extremely sensitive to medication, so i started at a dose of  mgs. and slowly titrated up to  mgs. i was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. it subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. my doctor prescribed ritalin and focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that i experienced during the day, and ambien for the insomnia that zoloft caused. i am still on ambien to this day. 

the worst effect of zoloft came when i tried to get off of it. it was total, utter hell. i have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation syndrome."" 

i first cut the dose down to  mgs. and did not experience problems. i then slowly titrated down over several months until i came off of it completely. over the next few weeks, i started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which i had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, i lost  pounds in  weeks. this was all extremely traumatic as i am a type  diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin i take. the panic attacks got so bad, i had to be on xanax xr everyday for months. i could not function normally or work. i tried to stick it out because i didn't want to go back on an ssri after all the trouble and side effects it caused. i went to a md who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me st. johns wort and i could manage with that until i got over the physical side effects of the ssri, but it didn't work. i eventually had to go back on an ssri just to function normally. i am on lexapro now. i managed to be drug free for the first  years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of zoloft, i am on ambien, lexapro, and valium occasionally for anxiety. to top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and i ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that i incurred from that. all because of zoloft. i will regret taking it the rest of my life."
0,"--- constant issues with the patch not staying on.  i called the manufacture (bayer), they took down the lot number and said we are sorry.  they said they were going to send a new box to my local pharmacy at no charge.  i have checked every week for the last three weeks and nothing!  yeah, great way to follow through.  throughout being on the patch i noticed large acne on my face, lack of energy, no libido, vaginal dryness, daily hot flashes and extreme moodiness (so sorry to my husband, even though he has been great through all of this).  i know it has only been three months and my body is trying to adjust, but i just could not take it anymore.  i contacted my gyn and he prescribed estratest.  cross your fingers i hope it works!!!! ---"
1,"controlled complex partial seizures. dizziness, fatigue, nausea started at  doses of  mg a day and worked up to  doses per day over a six month period. only at  mg a day did the drug control the seizures. during each time when i increased the dosage, i founf the side-effects worsened, but after a week or so, the side effects minimized and then disappeared."
0,the drug micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  my blood pressure is still higher than i or my doctor would like it to be. at the moment it averages about  over  but it was  over . therefore i would say it was somewhat efficacious. it also alleviated some headaches that i assume were blood pressure related. i find when i am taking micardis that i tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased. i take micardis in pill form once daily.
