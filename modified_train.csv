"This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.","I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth.","I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons.

"Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential.

"I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.","I gained 15 pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  BUT - I have always struggled to GAIN weight - I weighed 95 pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy 115 with a lot of hard work.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.  (Again, my doctor said ""This medication shouldn't do that. Maybe you have the flu."")  Last night, though, I had great sex with my husband and was able to orgasm easily.

"Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.","The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.","Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.

"Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks.",Barely any despite some slight confusion.,"This medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

It definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now I get the more frequently.  Like twice a month!!,ocassional diarrhea and headache.,"I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.

"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.","My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications.

Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet.","I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.",None.,I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve. I do this again at night as I get into bed. That's pretty much it!,1,"subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as vicodin, oxycodone, and even heroin. however, i was started on subutex because my doctor and i were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of effexor xr and adderall (which were only partially working). my doctor had found research suggesting that subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. my doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! i have had almost all good results from this medication. it has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. the following are the benefits that i have noticed from taking subutex:
     . quick-acting - because subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     . gentle effects - i have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.

"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

"After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts.

The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.","Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.","The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye.

Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted.

"Hello all !
Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription.","I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant.

I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

"The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.","There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.","I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.

"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.","None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.

"I do feel much more awake, but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.","Acne!!!!!!!!!!

I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it.

The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.,"This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.","This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either.

"This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.","Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.","The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient.

7. Bad experience for $200!!!","Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun.

"The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.).","The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.","I'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

"Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.","Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others.","Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.

I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life.","The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.","I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.  However I do feel guilty about having put her through that.",0,"taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  i was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before i didn't have any situations i considered safe.  it helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  i got pregnant while taking it (i had been trying for  years) and i honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as i had had four miscarraiges previously.  i started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though i have become housebound.  i feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life. the rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  however after taking it for a few years and feeling i no longer needed it, i found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  i have cut the dosage down considerably, from  mg at night to one, then i became nervous again and started taking  again.  i have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  i would always go back on it.  i never felt i needed more...i just coudn't stop taking even a small amount. i was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  as rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  i was prescribed it for this reason.  i am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

"Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When

Seemed to take effect after the first dose. I noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. I was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. I was having all kinds of muscle twitches so I went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels.

But so far I am happy with the results.,Slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. A bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable.,I am to meet up with my doctor again after 2 weeks to see how it is affecting me. I am taking 10mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. I have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. I don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... Meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like I want to better myself so in the end I am hoping that this is just a bandaid until I heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.,1,seemed to take effect after the first dose. i noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. i was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. i was having all kinds of muscle twitches so i went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. i am a mother and a wife and i was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad i did.. i am only a week into it so i guess time will tell. but so far i am happy with the results. slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. a bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable. i am to meet up with my doctor again after  weeks to see how it is affecting me. i am taking mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. i have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. i don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like i want to better myself so in the end i am hoping that this is just a bandaid until i heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.

"lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings","I've been lucky with side effects. It has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality.

"Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.

"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?","Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?

"I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.","As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.","I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission.",1,"i've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest i ever came to a ""cure"".

This time only the generic was available to me so I tried it - thinking that it would be the same drug and provide similar results.  It did not.

Benefits were I was able to stay awake during the day.

"Sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  Easy to take, just one pill a day!",I had no side effects with this drug!  I loved it.,"Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD.  It is a time-released capsule.  It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills! I was self-pay though, so I'm sure having insurance would be ideal! Although it is very expensive, it is well worth it.",1,"sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  easy to take, just one pill a day! i had no side effects with this drug!  i loved it. vyvanse is a new medication used to treat adhd.  it is a time-released capsule.  it is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  i took one mg pill in the morning.  the pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  this allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. i did not have any of the normal adhd med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  the only downside to this medication is the cost.  since vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  i paid $/month for  pills! i was self-pay though, so i'm sure having insurance would be ideal! although it is very expensive, it is well worth it."

"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds.",It ended my year long depression.,Please see above.,1,"i recently saw my pcp for my annual exam and had  major concerns to discuss with her.  the first was some depression issues and the second was that i had recently developed indoor allergies.  as is standard my pcp recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and claritin (hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  the problem is that i am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  on the other hand, my md approved claritin although i was nursing.  at the end of the session she told to to start on claritin and come back for the antidepressants once i weened my son.  so i started the claritin and my depression abated.  all of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  since i started taking claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  i feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  in terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  regardless, i am happy with the product.

"Initially the treatment benefits were
-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain)","The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.","I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive.

I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.

The medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.,"The side effects were mild compared to the pain.

This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours.","At the onset of the headache, I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night, around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.

noticed a significant improvement in exercise induced asthma/shortness of breath. Also I previously had a chronic cough/throat irritation prior to taking singulair and this is now gone. My asthma would act up when I drink or eat cold foods and this is no longer a problem. I haven't had bronchitis in over a year and would usually get 3-4 x  year.,Did not notice any side effects. There are reports of depression as side effects but since I suffer from depression anyway it's hard to tell. Haven had any worsening of depression since starting singulair.,Singulair has been very beneficial in controlling my asthma and bronchitis. Do not notice it helps much with my allergies though. I do take zyrtec for allergies but if I run out and still taking the singulair my allerties come right back.

"Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.

Medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years.,When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked.,The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital.

"Initially, Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better.","Although some stress was alleviated, I noticed that I spent more time in a ""vegetative"" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that.

"Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).",Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.,"My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes.

"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded.","The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.

None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects!,"Within hours of taking the first dose I had vaginal itching.  Since I read that was a side effect in the paperwork, I didn't think much of it.  After two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  I thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  The medication was taken at bedtime.  When I woke up after taking the third dose, I had blisters on the outer labia.  Late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, I was in severe pain.  The blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  During the drive, I felt so bad I was praying for my life so I could continue to raise my children, even though I do not believe in god!  It is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  My blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and I have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  I have not taken my temperature but I'm sure I have one.  I feel like I have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  I'm no doctor, but I highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use IMMEDIATELY upon ANY gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.

"So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.","Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this, I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began, I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.

"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

"Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)","It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.

"The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, TSH, T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again.","My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin, and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing.","Not sure theres much to describe. I had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days.

some reduction in lung inflammation,"Severe mood swings, depression, frequent lung infections","I took singulair for years before I realized that it was not really doing much and I strongly suspect that it contributed to my severe depression and mood swings.

I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25, I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well, have to start the Singulair again, that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.

"Elidel reduced my dry skin by about 80-85%. It increased exfoliation, which is very slowed down in hypothyroid-related dry skin, got rid of many of the blocked pores due to poor exfoliation, and stopped the vast majority of the flaking, burning, and redness I had suffered from before I used it.","The first week I used Elidel I got some flu-like symptoms, as warned on the package insert.

The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.,I find when I am taking Micardis that I tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased.,I take Micardis in pill form once daily.,0,the drug micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  my blood pressure is still higher than i or my doctor would like it to be. at the moment it averages about  over  but it was  over . therefore i would say it was somewhat efficacious. it also alleviated some headaches that i assume were blood pressure related. i find when i am taking micardis that i tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased. i take micardis in pill form once daily.
